<bibl n="1">Brussels, Biblioth&egrave;que Royale, 5301&ndash;5320, ff. 1a&ndash;36a; paper; s. xvii (AD 1643); scribe Dubhaltach Mac Fir Bhisigh; patron John Lynch. Mac Fir Bhisigh copied the text from a vellum MS, now lost, of Giolla na Naomh (alias Nehemias) Mac Aodhag&aacute;in, who may have died in 1443. This vellum MS was in poor condition, partly disbound, and illegible in places when Mac Fir Bhisigh copied it. The surviving text contains annals for the years 573&ndash;628, 662&ndash;704, 716&ndash;35, 851&ndash;73, 906&ndash;14. It may ultimately derive, at least in part, from annals kept at the monastery of Clonenagh. These annals are not known to have survived in any other manuscript.</bibl>

Now, he had waged war against
Clann Connla. And he was in his sleeping-place then, and his riches were all
there with him, as it was customary for the kings to have cubicles of yew about
them, that is, a partitioned place, for their bars and cases of silver and their
cups and goblets to give service at night, and their <term lang="ga">brandub</term> and <term lang="ga">fidchell</term> games and their bronze
hurley-sticks to use by day. Feradach had many treasures, and he loved them
greatly; but he had acquired them by evil means, for he would not hear of much
or little gold or silver, in the possession of either powerful or wretched in
Osraige, without confiscating it to take away that wealth, to ornament those treasures.
Feradach's sons came to his bed then to take the treasures away with them. 
<q>What do you want, sons?</q> asked Feradach. <q>To take the treasures away with us,</q> answered the youths. <q>You shall not take them,</q> said Feradach, <q>for they were ill-gotten;
I tormented many in gathering them, and I consent to being tormented
myself by my enemies on their account.</q></p>
<p>His sons left him, and he began fervent penance. Then Clann Connla
came, and they killed Feradach, and took the treasures; and Feradach

</div2>
<div2 n="FA 9">
<p>Once, when he <sup resp="JR">&Aacute;ed</sup>,  
not yet king, came through Othan Muru, he washed his hands in the river that goes 
through the middle of the town. 
 <pb n="7"/>
 
 
(Othna is the name of the river, and from it the town&mdash;i.e., Othna&mdash;is  
named.) He took a handful of water to put on his face. One of his men  
stopped him: <q>O king,</q> he said, <q>do not put that water on your face.</q> 
<q>Why?</q> asked the king. <q>I am ashamed to say,</q> said he. 
<q>What shame do you have at telling the truth?</q> asked the king. 
<q>This is it,</q> he replied; <q>the clergy's privy is over that water.</q> 
<q>Is it there,</q> asked the king, <q>that the cleric himself goes to defecate?</q> 
<q>It is indeed,</q> said the youth. 
<q>Not only,</q> said the king, <q>shall I put it upon my face, but I shall also 
put it in my mouth, and I shall drink it (drinking three mouthfuls of  
it), for the water into which his faeces go is a sacrament to me.</q></p>
<p>That was told to Muru, and he thanked God that Aed All&aacute;in had such  
faith. Then he summoned &Aacute;ed All&aacute;in to him (&Aacute;ed Uaridnach 
was another of his names), and Muru said to him: <q>Dear son,</q> he said,  
<q>as reward for that reverence you have given the church, I promise, in God's witness, 
that you will take the kingship of Ireland shortly, and that you will gain  
victory and the overthrow of your enemies, and that you will not be taken  
by sudden death, and you will receive the Body of the Lord from my  
hand, and I shall pray to the Lord on your behalf that it may be old age  
that will take you from the world.</q></p>
<p>It was not long afterwards that &Aacute;ed All&aacute;in took the kingship of 
Ireland, and he granted fertile lands to Muru of Othan. Moreover, &Aacute;ed 
All&aacute;in won many victories over the Laigin, and over his other enemies. He 
was eight years in the kingship of Ireland, and then mortal illness seized 
&Aacute;ed All&aacute;in and he sent for Muru. Muru came, and the king said to 
him, 
<q>Cleric,</q> he said, <q>you have deceived me, for I have neglected my 
penance, because I expected, through your word, that I would be aged in my 
lifetime; and it seems to me that death is near me.</q> 
<q>True,</q> said the cleric, <q>death is near you, and your life has been cut 
short, and you have incurred the Lord's anger; so explain all that you 
have done to offend the Lord.</q> 
<q>I shall relate,</q> said the king, <q>that which I think likely to have  
offended the Lord. I attempted,</q> said he, <q>to gather the men of Ireland to  
this mountain to the east, that is, to Carrl&oacute;eg, to build it up, and to  
construct a huge house on it, and I wished that the fire of that house  
might be seen every evening in Britain and Argyle; and I know that that  
was great arrogance.</q> 
<q>That was evil,</q> said the cleric, <q>but it is not that which has shortened 
your life.</q>
 <pb n="9"/>
 
 
<q>Moreover,</q> I attempted,<q> said the king, to build a bridge at Cluain 
Iraird, and to build it marvellously, so that my name would endure on  
it forever.</q> He related many similar things. 
<q>It is none of these things,</q> said the cleric, <q>that is cutting short 
your life.</q> <q>I have something else, then,</q> said the king; <q>that is, the hatred I 
have for the Laigin; for this is what I desired: to force all their men to  
battle, and to slay them all then, and to bring their women and slaves  
to serve the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill; and to bring us of northern Ireland into 
Mide, and the men of Mide into Leinster.</q> 
<q>Alas, alas!</q> said the cleric, <q>it is that which has shortened your  
life, for that tribe which you hate, that is, the Laigin, have saints  
praying on their behalf in the presence of the Lord; Brigit is greater <sup resp="JR">than  
I</sup>, and her prayers are more powerful than my own. Nevertheless, the  
Lord is merciful and forbearing; make offerings yourself to Him on  
account of that malice that was in your heart towards the Laigin, so that you 
may be in a Kingdom more lasting than the temporal kingdom.</q></p>
<p>Then the king was anointed, and he received the Body of the Lord, and he died at  
once, and went to heaven.</p>

<pb n="11"/>
<div2 n="FA 17">
<p>One day, as Fiachna, the father of 
that Suibne, was going to inspect his plowing&mdash;for he himself was not a 
king at all&mdash;he brought to his mind how each person succeeded another in 
the kingship of Ireland. Pride and great arrogance came over him, and greed to 
seize the sovereignty of Ireland, and he came home and told this to his wife, 
and this is what his wife said to him: <q>Since you have not attempted that 
before now</q>, she said, <q>I do not see that it is suitable for a man of 
your age and antiquity to be fighting at this time for a kingdom. For it is not <gap/></q> 
<q>Be quiet;</q> said he, <q>don't get in my way; but have food and drink brought 
in,</q> said he, <q>and let the noblemen be invited out to visit us, and let 
them be given their fill.</q> And he summoned his wife to him then, and he lay 
with her, and every plan that had been in his mind before he put away from him 
through the act of procreation, and after that it was his wife who possessed the 
intentions that he had had, and it was then that this Suibne Menn was conceived 
in the womb of his mother.</p>
<p>When he rose from the woman, she asked, <q>Shall everyone be invited in?</q> 
<q>No,</q> said Fiachna, <q>we will not make ourselves ridiculous&mdash;that is, 
by fighting for the kingship henceforward.</q> Now from that it is to be 
understood that it is from the pre-existing great ambitions of parents that 
children with great ambitions are born.</p>
<p>Now, one day when this Suibne, as a young man, was in his house with his 
wife, he said to his wife, <q>I am amazed,</q> he said, <q>that so few of the 
Cen&eacute;l E&oacute;gain have taken the lordship over all, up to this time.</q></p>
<p>His wife replied, with a kind of sarcasm, <q>What's wrong with you, that 
you don't use force, and go before them to fight with everyone, and win frequent 
victories?</q> 
<q>That's the way it will be,</q> he said. Consequently he came out armed the 
following morning, and he met a warrior of the people of the <sup resp="JR">country</sup>,  
who was armed, and he gave battle to him until the warrior submitted to him at 
spear-point; and a huge host submitted to him in that manner, and he took the 
kingship of Ireland.</p>

</div2>
<div2 n="FA 67">
<p>Here below are some of the stories of F&iacute;nnachta.</p>
<p><sup resp="JR">I</sup> This F&iacute;nnachta was at first poor and unprosperous. He had a house and a wife, but he had no stock except for a single ox and one cow. On one occasion 
the king of Fir Rois happened to be lost and wandering astray in the vicinity of 
F&iacute;nnachta's cottage. There had never before been a night worse than that 
one with storm and snow and darkness, and the king and his wife and attendants 
could not get to the house that they wished to reach because of the foul weather 
and the darkness, and they were talking about spending the night under the 
trees. F&iacute;nnachta heard them in that conversation, for they were not far 
from his cottage then, and he came to meet them on the road, and this is what he 
said to them: that it would be better for them to come to his cottage, such as 
it was, than to wander in the dark, stormy night.</p>
<p>The king and his attendants said: <q>It is true, it is better,</q> they said, 
<q>and we are indeed glad that you have told us so.</q> They came then to his 
house, and the size of the house was greater than its wealth. F&iacute;nnachta 
knocked his ox on the head, and he knocked the cow on the head also. The king's 
own attendants prepared them swiftly and speedily, by spit and by kettle, and 
they ate until they were full. They slept well after that until morning came.</p>
<p>In the morning the king of Fir Rois said to his wife, <q>Don't you know, 
woman, that although this house was poor formerly, it is poorer now, because its 
only cow and its only ox have been slaughtered for us?</q> 
<q>That is indeed true,</q> said the woman; <q>now it is proper for us to make 
it rich. However much or little you give to the man, I will give its equal to 
his wife.</q> 
<q>What you say is good,</q> said the king. Then the king gave Finnachta a huge 
herd of cows, and many pigs and sheep, along with their herdsmen. The king's 
wife accordingly gave to F&iacute;nnachta's wife the same amount. Then they gave 
them beautifully decorated clothing and fine horses, and everything that they 
needed in the world.</p>
<p><sup resp="JR">II</sup>  
It was not long afterwards that F&iacute;nnachta came with a large 
horsetroop to the house of one of his sisters, having been invited by the 
sister, and owing her a visit in return. As they were going on the journey, they 
met Adamn&aacute;n, then a young scholar, travelling on the same road, with a 
jug full of milk on his back, and as he was running out of the way of the <pb n="25"/>
  
 
horse-troop his foot struck against a stone, and he fell with the jug so that it 
was broken to bits; and though the horses were swift, Adamn&aacute;n was no 
slower with his broken jug on his back, and he sad and gloomy. When 
F&iacute;nnachta saw him, he burst out laughing, and he was saying to 
Adamn&aacute;n, <q>That will make you joyful, for I am willing to make good 
every injury in my power. You will receive compensation for it from me, 
student,</q> said F&iacute;nnachta, <q>so do not be sad.</q> 
Adamn&aacute;n said: <q>Nobleman,</q> said he, <q>I have reason for grief, for 
there are three noble scholars in the same house, and they have us as three 
servants, and one of the servants goes out looking for sustenance for the other 
five men; and it fell to me to gather things for them today; what I had intended 
for them fell to the ground, and there is something more grievous, that is, the 
borrowed jug has broken, and I do not have the price of it.</q> 
<q>I will pay for the jug,</q> said F&iacute;nnachta, <q>and you bring with you 
tonight, to the house where we are going, the five who are without food, 
depending on you; and they will receive food and drink from us.</q></p>
<p>That was done accordingly; they brought the other four clerics, and the 
ale-house was arranged, half of the house for clerics and the other half for 
laymen. Adamn&aacute;n's tutor was filled with the grace of the Holy Spirit, and 
the spirit of prophecy, and he said, <q>The man who has given this banquet will 
be the High King of Ireland, and Adamn&aacute;n will be the head of piety and 
wisdom of Ireland, and he will be F&iacute;nnachta's confessor, and 
F&iacute;nnachta will be in great prosperity until he gives offense to 
Adamn&aacute;n.</q></p>
<p><sup resp="JR">III</sup>  
Not long after that F&iacute;nnachta and the king of Fir Rois, his friend, 
went to visit his father's kinsman, i.e. Cenn F&aacute;elad, to request lands 
from him. Cenn F&aacute;elad gave him the high-stewardship over all of Mide from 
the Sinann to the sea, that is, over the twenty-four <term lang="ga">tuatha</term>. F&iacute;nnachta held that position for some time. He came to consult his friend, the king of Fir Rois, as to what he should do, for he was not satisfied as he was. He gave him 
hard and heroic advice, and said to him: <q>Doesn't Slige Asail divide Mide in 
two? Make one half of Mide faithful and devoted to you, and when that half is 
loyal to you, arrange a meeting with the other half, and kill their noblemen, 
their pillars of battle; and you will get not only the full kingship of Mide, 
but even the kingship of Temair if you wish it.</q></p>
<p>F&iacute;nnachta took that advice, and afterwards he challenged his father's 
kinsman, i.e. Cenn F&aacute;elad, to battle. When Cenn F&aacute;elad's wife 
heard that, she was blaming her husband for giving the stewardship to 
F&iacute;nnachta. 
 <pb n="27"/>
  
 
lt was then that the woman sang <q>There closed,</q> etc., <frn lang="la">ut supra</frn><note n="1" type="auth">See FA 62 above, p. 21.</note>. A battle 
was then fought hard and heroically between them, i.e. between Cenn 
F&aacute;elad and F&iacute;nnachta, in Aircheltair, and Cenn F&aacute;elad was 
killed there, and many along with him. Then F&iacute;nnachta took the kingship 
of Ireland for twenty years.</p>
<p><sup resp="JR">IV</sup>  
It was that F&iacute;nnachta who remitted the <term lang="ga" type="cattle-tribute">B&oacute;roma</term> to MoLing, after it had been levied 
by forty kings previously, i.e. from Tuathal Techtmar to F&iacute;nnachta. 
MoLing came on behalf of all the Laigin to seek remission of the <term lang="ga" type="cattle-tribute">B&oacute;roma</term> from F&iacute;nnachta. Now MoLing 
asked F&iacute;nnachta to remit the <term lang="ga" type="cattle-tribute">B&oacute;roma</term> for a day and a night. F&iacute;nnachta accordingly remitted the <term lang="ga" type="cattle-tribute">B&oacute;roma</term> for a day and a night. To MoLing that 
was the same as remitting it forever: for there is nothing in time but day and 
night. However, F&iacute;nnachta had thought that it was for one day and one 
night only. MoLing went out and said, <q>You have granted a stay of it 
forever.</q> And on the previous day MoLing had promised heaven to F&iacute;nnachta.</p>
<p>Then F&iacute;nnachta understood that MoLing had tricked him, and he said to 
his followers, <q>Rise up,</q> he said, <q>after the holy man who has left me, 
and tell him that I granted a stay of but one day and one night to him, for it 
seems to me that the holy man has deceived me, since there is nothing except day 
and night in the whole world.</q> When MoLing knew that they were coming after 
him, he ran swiftly and speedily till he reached his house, and the king's 
attendants did not catch up with him at all.</p>
<p>Others say that MoLing brought a poem with him to F&iacute;nnachta, namely 
<title>F&iacute;nnachta over the U&iacute; Neill,</title> etc. (That is written in the 
<frn lang="ga">B&oacute;roma</frn> in this book). So the <term lang="ga" type="cattle-tribute">B&oacute;roma</term> was remitted to MoLing forever, and 
although F&iacute;nnachta regretted that, he was not able to levy it, for it was 
for the sake of heaven that he had remitted it. And this is truer.</p>
<p>In the fifteenth year from this year F&iacute;nnachta remitted the <term lang="ga" type="cattle-tribute">B&oacute;roma</term>. Adamn&aacute;n came to see 
F&iacute;nnachta immediately after MoLing, and he sent a cleric from his retinue 
for F&iacute;nnachta, that he might come to talk with him. F&iacute;nnachta was 
playing <term lang="ga">fidchell</term> at that time. <q>Come and talk to 
Adamn&aacute;n,</q> said the cleric. 
<q>I will not go until this game is over,</q> answered F&iacute;nnachta. 
The cleric came to Adamn&aacute;n, and told him F&iacute;nnachta's reply. 
<q>Go to him, and tell him: I will sing fifty psalms meanwhile, and there is a 
psalm in that fifty in which I shall pray to the Lord that neither son nor 
descendant of yours, nor any man of the same name, shall ever take the kingship 
of Ireland.</q></p>
<p>The cleric went and said that to F&iacute;nnachta, and F&iacute;nnachta paid 
no attention to it, but played his <term lang="ga">fidchell</term> until the game 
was finished. <q>Come and talk to Adamn&aacute;n, F&iacute;nnachta,</q> said the 
cleric. <q>I will not go,</q> said F&iacute;nnachta, <q>until this game is finished.</q></p>
<pb n="29"/>
<p>The cleric told that to Adamn&aacute;n. <q>Tell him,</q> said Adamn&aacute;n, 
<q>that I shall sing fifty psalms during that time, and there is a special psalm 
among that fifty, and in that psalm I shall ask and demand that the Lord shorten 
his life.</q></p>
<p>The cleric told that to F&iacute;nnachta, and F&iacute;nnachta paid it no 
attention, but played his <term lang="ga">fidchell</term> until the game was 
finished. <q>Come and talk to Adamn&aacute;n,</q> said the cleric. 
<q>I will not go,</q> said F&iacute;nnachta, <q>until this game is over.</q></p>
<p>The cleric came back, and he told Adamn&aacute;n F&iacute;nnachta's answer. 
<q>Go to him,</q> said Adamn&aacute;n, <q>and tell him that I will sing the 
third fifty, and there is a special psalm in that fifty, and I will pray the 
Lord in that psalm that he may not reach the kingdom of heaven.</q></p>
<p>The cleric returned to F&iacute;nnachta, and reported that. When 
F&iacute;nnachta heard it, he abruptly threw the <term lang="ga">fidchell</term> 
from him and came to Adamn&aacute;n. <q>What has brought you to me now,</q> 
asked Adamn&aacute;n, <q>since you did not come at the other messages?</q> 
<q>This is my reason,</q> answered F&iacute;nnachta; <q>the threats that you 
made against me before, that is, that neither son nor grandson should succeed 
me, and that no man of my name should hold the kingship of Ireland, or that my 
life should be shortened&mdash;those seemed light to me. But when you promised 
to deprive me of heaven, it was on that account that I came immediately to talk 
to you, because I cannot bear this.</q> 
<q>Is it true,</q> asked Adamn&aacute;n, <q>that you have remitted the <term lang="ga" type="cattle-tribute">B&oacute;roma</term> day and night to 
MoLing?</q>

from Adamn&aacute;n's curse. But all the same, Adamn&aacute;n deceived him: 
Adamn&aacute;n was talking to one of the clerics of his household, saying, 
<q>You be here tonight instead of me, with my clothes on you, and when 
&Iacute;rgalach comes to ask you what you will do tonight, say that you will be 
feasting and sleeping, so that he will do the same</q>&mdash; for it was easier 
for Adamn&aacute;n that one of his people should lie than he himself.</p>
<p>Then &Iacute;rgalach came to that cleric, and he thought that it was 
Adamn&aacute;n who was there. &Iacute;rgalach asked him, <q>What will you do 
tonight, cleric?</q> <q>Feast and sleep,</q> said the cleric.</p>
<p>So &Iacute;rgalach feasted and slept that night. Adamn&aacute;n, on the other 
hand, fasted and kept vigil and stayed in the B&oacute;and till morning. While 
&Iacute;rgalach was asleep, he saw Adamn&aacute;n up to his neck in the water, 
and he started violently out of his sleep because of that, and he told it to his 
wife. Now his wife was humble and obedient to the Lord and to Adamn&aacute;n, 
because 
 <pb n="49"/>
  
 
she was pregnant and was afraid that her child might be harmed through 
Adamn&aacute;n's curse, and she used often to beseech Adamn&aacute;n not to harm 
or curse her child.</p>
<p>&Iacute;rgalach rose early the next morning, and Adamn&aacute;n came to see 
him. Adamn&aacute;n said to him: <q>Cursed son,</q> said he, <q>hardest and 
worst man of God's making, know that shortly you will be separated from your 
sovereignty, and you will go to Hell.</q></p>
<p>When &Iacute;rgalach's wife heard that, she came before Adamn&aacute;n and 
lay at his feet, and besought him for God's sake not to curse her child, the 
infant that was in her womb. Adamn&aacute;n said, <q>The infant in your womb 
will be king indeed, but one of his eyes is now broken as a result of the 
cursing of his father.</q> And that is how it was. The boy was born immediately 
after that, and he was half blind.</p>

Loingsech son of Oengus into the territory of the Connachtmen, to destroy and

Cellach son of Rogallach, and they were saying that it was not fitting for a 
shaky old king like Cellach to challenge or contend with the King of Ireland, 
and that if he did, he would be defeated. Nevertheless it did not turn out that 
way, but just the opposite. For when that Cellach, king of Connacht, saw his 
land and his territory being destroyed and plundered, he called to him the two 
D&uacute;nchads, i.e. D&uacute;nchad of Muiresc and the other D&uacute;nchad; 
and he had decided beforehand that it was they who should take the kingship of 
Connacht after himself. He had just bathed and put oil and many royal herbs on 
himself. He placed one of the two men aforesaid (i.e. one of the two 
D&uacute;nchads) on his right side, and one on his left side, and he arranged 
the Connachtmen around him for the battle. He himself (Cellach) sprang from his 
chariot swiftly and far from the chariot, and the cracking of the old man's 
bones was audible as he leaped out of the chariot. And after that he said, in a 
loud voice, springing to the nearby battle: <q>Connachtmen, defend and protect 
your own freedom, for the people who are against you are not nobler or braver 
than you, and they have not done any better <sup resp="JR">than you</sup> up to now.</q>

Loingsech, the King of Ireland, was slain there with a massacre of his people,

<p><date value="703DMC">703</date> The Celebration of Easter.</p>
<p>In this year the men of Ireland accepted a single regulation and rule from 
Adamn&aacute;n, regarding the celebration of Easter on Sunday, the fourteenth of 
the moon of April, and regarding the wearing of Peter's tonsure by all the 
clergy of Ireland; for there had been great disturbance in Ireland until then, 
that is, many of the Irish clergy were celebrating Easter 
 <pb n="57"/>
  
 
on Sunday, the fourteenth of the moon of April, and were wearing the tonsure of 
Peter the Apostle, following Patrick. Many others, however, were following Colum 
Cille, celebrating Easter on the fourteenth of the moon of April no matter on 
which day of the week the fourteenth happened to fall, and wearing the tonsure 
of Simon Magus. A third group was not in accord with either the followers of 
Patrick or those of Colum Cille. So the clergy of Ireland used to hold many 
synods. And this is how those clerics used to come to the synods: with their 
people, so that there used to be battle challenges, and many slain among them; 
and many evils came to Ireland on that account, i.e. the great cattle murrain, 
and the vast famine, and many plagues, and foreigners destroying Ireland. It was 
like that for a long time, that is, until the time of Adamn&aacute;n. He was the 
ninth abbot of &Iacute; after Colum Cille.</p>
<p>The Saxons took a great prey from Ireland. Adamn&aacute;n went to redeem the 
hostages. And as Bede tells it in Bede's History, most of the bishops of all 
Europe gathered to condemn Adamn&aacute;n for celebrating Easter according to 
Colum Cille, and for wearing the tonsure of Simon Magus (that is, from ear to 
ear). Bede says that there were many wise men in that synod, and that 
Adamn&aacute;n exceeded them all in wisdom and eloquence. Adamn&aacute;n said 
that it was not in imitation <sup resp="JR">of Simon Magus</sup> that he wore that tonsure, but it 
was rather in imitation of John the Beloved, pupil of the Savior, and that that 
was the tonsure he had worn; and that though his Savior was beloved to Peter, 
John was beloved to the Savior; and that it was on the fourteenth of the moon of 
April, whatever day of the week it might be, that the apostles celebrated 
Easter.</p>
<p>Then an old man arose there, and said, <q>Even if it were Colum Cille himself 
who was present here, we would not part from him until he were under the same 
rule as we. As for you, too, you will not be left alone until you are under the 
same rule as we.</q> 
Adamn&aacute;n answered him, and said, <q>I will be under the same rule as 
you.</q> 
<q>Let yourself be tonsured, then,</q> said the bishops. <q>It is sufficient,</q> said Adamn&aacute;n, <q><sup resp="JR">that it be done</sup> at my own 
monastery.</q> <q>No,</q> they said, <q>but at once.</q> Adamn&aacute;n was tonsured then, and 
no greater honor has been given to a man than that which was accorded to 
Adamn&aacute;n then, and that large booty was surrendered to him, and he 
proceeded to his own monastery, &Iacute;.</p>
<p>His congregation was greatly amazed to see him with that tonsure. He was 
always urging the congregation to adopt the tonsure, and he could not get their 
consent. But God permitted the community to sin, that is, to expel that 
Adamn&aacute;n who had compassion for Ireland. This is what Bede says; for Bede 
was with Adamn&aacute;n while he was in England.</p>
<pb n="59"/>
<p>After that Adamn&aacute;n came to Ireland, and he proclaimed that <sup resp="JR">rule</sup> in 
Ireland, and that single regulation for Easter and the tonsure was not accepted 
from him until this year.</p>

<p><date value="721">721</date> A raid on the Laigin by Fergal 
son of M&aacute;el D&uacute;in. In other books of history I find that it was in 
the third year before, that is, in the tenth year of the reign of Fergal, that 
this raid on the Laigin was made, and that it was in revenge for it that Murchad 
brought the son of Finguine with the men of Munster to raid Mag Breg. Whichever 
of those years it was, though, Fergal made a great raid on the Laigin, that is 
to say, he burned and roasted and slew them, and he swore he would not cease 
until the <term lang="ga" type="cattle-tribute">B&oacute;roma</term> which 
F&iacute;nnachta remitted to MoLing was given to him, and until hostages were 
given to him in recognition of his lordship and of the tribute. The Laigin gave 
him hostages, and they promised the tribute.</p>
</div2>
<div2 n="FA 177">
<p><date value="721DMC">721</date> It was at this time that Fergal 
made a prophecy for his sons, &Aacute;ed All&aacute;in and Niall Condail, and 
this is how that happened:</p>
<p>They came one day to visit him at Ailech Frigrenn. &Aacute;ed, the elder son, a prime, clever, cruel and vigorous warrior, came thus to Ailech: with large, well-armed troops around him. But the younger son came thus: calmly and temperately, peacefully, with few attendants, and this is 
what he said, from his own diffidence and to honor his father: <q>It would be 
more proper for me,</q> he said, <q>to lodge outside than to stay as a guest 
with you tonight.</q> 
<q>What is wrong with you, son,</q> said the father, <q>that you should say 
that, when the boy who is older than you has three times your attendants, and 
you do not have the confidence to stay in Ailech tonight as he is staying with 
his company?</q> 
<q>I would prefer,</q> said Niall, <q>that he should behave in the same way 
towards you.</q> 
<q>Do not go tonight at all, son,</q> said Fergal, <q>and be near your father 
and mother.</q></p>
<p>After that the older son, &Aacute;ed, was brought into the great palace with 
his company. The young son, Niall, however, was brought to a lovely secluded 
house. Then they were entertained; and their father wished to test them both, so 
he came in the last part of the night to the house in which the elder son was 
staying, and he was listening at that house: it was very foul indeed inside that 
house. There were buffoons and satirists and horseboys and jugglers and oafs, 
roaring and bellowing there. Some were drinking, some sleeping, some vomiting, 
some piping, some whistling. Drummers and harpers were playing; a group was 
boasting and arguing. Fergal heard them thus. And he came then to visit the 
secluded house where the younger son was staying; and he listened at that house, 
and he heard nothing there but thanksgiving to God for all that they had 
received, and sweet, quiet harp playing, and the singing of praise songs to the 
Lord. 
 <pb n="63"/>
  
 
And the king saw that great fear and love of the Lord were in that house. After 
that the king came to his own bed, and considered deeply the situation of those 
two houses.</p>
<p>Early in the morning he entered the great house where the elder son was 
staying, and he could scarcely pass through the house on account of the vomiting 
and filth and stench, and the number of dogs that were eating the vomit. And all 
inside were snoring as if they were dead, except for the king's son himself, and 
this is how he was sleeping: in his royal bed, as if he were waiting for battle, 
with a great shield on his left side, and two huge javelins on his right side, a 
long gold-hilted inlaid sword on his thigh, taking in and letting out great 
gasps, such as no one should do, however strong or agile.</p>
<p>He was unable to remain inside because of the great foulness of the air in 
that house, so he came into the house where the younger son was staying, and 
although he came quietly, the youth saw him, for he was not sleeping, but 
praying to the Lord. He rose immediately from the royal bed to greet his father, 
for he was thus: in a silk tunic, with gold and silver borders; and he opened 
the house for his father, and when his father came inside, he put his arms 
around his son's neck and gave him a kiss, and they came and sat together on the 
royal bed; and the son began first to converse with his father. And this is what 
he said: <q>Father, it seems to us that you have spent this past night sleepless 
and troubled; you should sleep now in that bed until daybreak.</q></p>
<p>The father did so, and when daybreak came they rose together, and the son said to his 
father, <q>Dear father, it would be proper for you to feast with us for a time 
here, for we still have half of the food and drink that was brought to us from 
you last night.</q> And he had not finished saying that when servants brought 
out a huge vessel full of mead, and various foods, and they feasted together 
silently and peacefully then.</p>
<p>When everyone had risen, the king came out into his own house, and he 
predicted, in the presence of all, what the fortunes of his two sons yonder 
would be. He said that the elder son would take the kingship, and that his reign 
would be strong, heroic, vigorous, terrifying and lustful. The younger son, 
however, would take the kingship piously and honestly, and his descendants would 
be famous and royal, and would take the kingship every second time. And that has 
been fulfilled so far.</p>
<p>Now the daughter of Congal son of Fergus of F&aacute;nad was the mother of 
the older son (that is, &Aacute;ed All&aacute;in), and she bore that son 
secretly. And this is the reason why Fergal had the girl secretly. Her father, 
Congal, dedicated her to the Lord, and she was a nun, and her father had given 
her much gold and silver and cattle for protecting her chastity. However, 
 <pb n="65"/>
  
 
the universal enemy of the human race (that is, the Devil) deceived her; she 
gave her love to Fergal son of M&aacute;el D&uacute;in, and Fergal loved her. 
Fergal and the daughter of Congal Cennmagar slept together. Fergal was <term lang="ga" type="king-worthy">r&iacute;gdomna</term> of Ireland at that time. 
Congal was King of Ireland.</p>
<p>The man who was <sup resp="JR">messenger</sup> between them told that to Congal. Congal was 
greatly grief-stricken by that news, that is, that his daughter had been 
seduced, and he said that the bearer of the tale would not live, unless he 
procured the proof of that story. So the bearer of the tale was waiting until 
Fergal and Congal's daughter should be together, and when they were together, 
the tale-bearer sought Congal, and told him that they were together. Congal came 
to the house where they were, and when Congal's daughter saw him coming to the 
house with his attendants&mdash; for she was clever, crafty, and spiteful, as 
was her father&mdash;she hid Fergal under the bedclothes, and then sat on the 
bedclothes herself. A big cat that was inside came and found Fergal and bit at 
his legs, and the cat swallowed big pieces of Fergal's legs. Fergal put his hand 
out and took the cat by the an neck, and killed it. Congal searched in the 
house, but he did not find Fergal there. He went to the bearer of the tale and 
drowned him in a river. Afterwards he came to see his own daughter, and he asked 
her forgiveness, since she was a virgin, so that his sin against her might not 
be upon him. It was at that secret tryst that &Aacute;ed All&aacute;in was 
conceived.</p>
<p>Now after &Aacute;ed All&aacute;in was born, his mother turned him over to 
two trustworthy women to be drowned, so that her father might not find her out 
and be angry with her. Now one of these women was of Cen&eacute;l Conaill, and 
one was of Cen&eacute;l E&oacute;gain. When the woman of Cen&eacute;l 
E&oacute;gain took the lovely little baby into her arms, she was filled with 
love and tenderness for the infant, and she said to her woman companion: <q>Dear 
sister, it is not right to destroy this baby, but rather to keep it 
well.</q> 
The other answered, <q>He is dearer to you than to his own mother, and it is 
she who has commanded us to drown him, for fear of her father's anger.</q> She 
became angry, and she set the child on the ground, and they fought each other, 
one for protecting, the other for drowning him. The woman of Cen&eacute;l 
E&oacute;gain overcame the other woman, and she clutched her by her Adam's apple 
until she agreed to everything&mdash;namely, to caring for the child. Thereafter 
they brought up the child together.</p>
<p>Once, four years later, the mother of the child happened to come into the 
house where he was, without knowing that he was alive. The little boy was 
playing there. His mother's mind turned to him, and she asked, <q>How old is 
that boy over there?</q> Everyone said that he was four years old. She called 
the trustworthy women over to her, and said to them, <q>The sin I have committed 
is great, destroying a boy of that age to escape the anger of my father.</q></p>
<pb n="67"/>
<p><q>Do not grieve at all,</q> said the women. <q>That is that boy yonder, and we 
have protected him.</q> Then she gave many gifts to the women, and the boy was 
taken secretly from them to his own father, Fergal.</p>
<p>Now the mother of Niall Condail <sup resp="JR">'Niall the Worthy'</sup> was the daughter of the 
king of Cianachta, and she was the fairest and most beautiful woman in Ireland 
in her time. However, she was childless for a long time, until she came to the 
holy nun Luaithrinn to ask her to pray to the Lord on her behalf to aid her. 
Luaithrinn did that, and Niall was conceived thereafter in the womb of the 
daughter of the king of Cianachta, and then he was born; and at that time she 
was Fergal's queen of Ireland.</p>
<p>All of this aside, when he spoke concerning his sons, as we have recounted, 
he urged and commanded each and every one of them <sup resp="JR">his men</sup> to assemble all 
their forces the next year to invade the Laigin, to levy the <term lang="ga" type="cattle-tribute">B&oacute;roma</term> upon them, for the Laigin had not 
fulfilled what they had promised.</p>
</div2>
<div2 n="FA 178">
<p><date value="722">722</date> Kl. From the beginning of the 
world 5924 years. From the Incarnation of the Lord 722 years.</p>
<p>The Battle of Almu between the Laigin and U&iacute; N&eacute;ill. This battle 
was fought on the third of the Ides of December. The cause of this battle was 
that the <term lang="ga" type="cattle-tribute">B&oacute;roma</term>, which 
F&iacute;nnachta remitted to MoLing, was levied by Fergal, and the Laigin would 
not tolerate that. The Laigin did not pay it to Loingsech son of Oengus, and 
they did not pay it to Congal Cennmagar, although they had suffered great 
harrassment from Congal; nor did they have any greater wish to pay it to Fergal, 
since they trusted in the words of MoLing, who had promised that the <term lang="ga" type="cattle-tribute">B&oacute;roma</term> would never again be levied 
from the Laigin. That perturbed Fergal&mdash;that is, that the Laigin would not 
keep their pledges to him&mdash;so he commanded a vast, irresistible hosting 
from Leth Cuinn, that is, from Connachta, and Cen&eacute;l Conaill, and 
Airgialla, and Mide, in the fourteenth year of his own reign, or in the 
thirteenth year, as some will have it, to levy the <term lang="ga" type="cattle-tribute">B&oacute;roma</term>.</p>
<p>Now that muster of troops took a long time, for every man of Leth Cuinn, when 
the order came to him, would say, <q>If Donn B&oacute; comes on the hosting, I 
shall come.</q> Now this Donn B&oacute; was the son of a widow of the Fir Rois, 
and he never went away from his mother's house for a day or a night, and there 
was no one in all Ireland who was more beloved, or fairer of form or figure or 
build than he. There was no one in all Ireland who was more valorous or more 
skillful than he, and his were the best amusing poems and royal stories in the 
world; it was he who was best at training horses, and setting spears, and 
braiding hair; and he was a man with royal nature in his countenance, of whom 
was said:

<text type="poem">
<body>
<lg n="1" type="quatrain">
<l>More lovely than all boys is dear Donn B&oacute;;</l>
<l>more sweet his song than all utterances of the mouth;</l>
<l>more glorious than all the warriors of Inis F&aacute;il;</l>
<l>...</l>
</lg>

</text> 
 
But his mother would not let Donn B&oacute; go with Fergal until M&aacute;el son 
of Failbe son of Erann&aacute;n son of Crimthann, successor of Colum Cille, was 
pledged for his return alive, and until he pledged Colum Cille on his behalf, 
moreover, that Donn B&oacute; would return safe to his own house from the 
territory of the Laigin.</p>
<p>Then Fergal set out on his way. There were guides going before him, but the 
guidance they gave him was not good: into the narrow places of each path, and 
into the rough places of each path, until they reached Cluain D&oacute;bail 
<sup resp="JR">'the Unlucky Meadow</sup> in Almu. &Aacute;ed&aacute;n, the leper of Cluain 
D&oacute;bail, was there before them. The army behaved badly: they slaughtered 
his only cow and roasted it on spits in his presence, and they took his house 
despite him and burned it; so the leper said that the punishment the Lord would 
inflict on the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill would be eternal. The leper went to 
Fergal's tent, and the kings of Leth Cuinn were all before him in the tent at 
that time. In their presence the leper complained of his ill-treatment, but the 
heart of none was moved for him, except the heart of C&uacute; Bretan son of 
Congus, the king of Fir Rois, and C&uacute; Bretan did not regret that, for 
except for C&uacute; Bretan son of Congus alone, none of the kings who was in 
the tent escaped from the battle. It was on that occasion that C&uacute; Bretan 
said:

<l>I fear a crimson, bloody battle,</l>

Then Fergal said to Donn B&oacute;, <q>Entertain us, Donn B&oacute;, for you are 
the best musician in Ireland, with flutes and piping, and with harps and poems 
 <pb n="71"/>
  
 
and talk and royal stories of Ireland, and tomorrow morning we give battle to 
the Laigin.</q> 
<q>No,</q> said Donn B&oacute;, <q>I cannot amuse you tonight, and I do not 
possess one of all those accomplishments to demonstrate tonight; but wherever 
you are tomorrow, and wherever I shall be, I will entertain you. Let the royal 
fool &Uacute;a Maigl&eacute;ine amuse you tonight.</q></p>
<p>&Uacute;a Maigl&eacute;ine was brought to them then. He set about telling the 
battles and combats of Leth Cuinn and the Laigin, from the destruction of Tuaim 
Tenbath (that is, Dind R&iacute;g) in which Cobthach C&oacute;el Breg was 
killed, up until that time; and they did not sleep much that night because of 
their great fear of the Laigin, and because of the severity of the weather, for 
it was the eve of the feast of Finnian, in the winter.</p>
<p>As for the Laigin, they went to Cruachan Cloenta, for the Laigin used not to 
be defeated if they made their plans there and then proceeded from there to the 
battle. Afterwards they went to Dind Canand. The following morning the troops of 
both sides met: nine thousand of the Laigin, and twenty-one thousand of Leth 
Cuinn. The battle was waged strongly and fiercely on both sides, and everyone 
took part in the fighting there. The combats of the Laigin and Leth Cuinn 
warriors would be excessive to relate. It is said that Brigit was seen over the 
Laigin; Colum Cille, moreover, was seen over the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill. The 
battle was won by Murchad son of Bran, and by &Aacute;ed son of Donnchad son of 
Colcu, king of Laigin Desgabair. Fergal was slain there. &Aacute;ed Mend and 
D&uacute;nchad son of Murchad killed Fergal himself and Bile son of Bain, king 
of Alba, from whom Corr Bile in Almu gets its name. Moreover, it was &Aacute;ed 
Mend who slew Donn B&oacute;. However, Fergal did not fall until after Donn 
B&oacute; fell. One hundred and sixty mercenaries were slain in that place. The 
Laigin killed their own number&mdash;that is, nine thousand&mdash;of the men of 
Leth Cuinn in that battle, and nine of them went mad, and one hundred of the 
kings. The Hill of Fergal is there. The Laigin raised shouts of triumph there, 
whence was said: 
 
<text type="poem">

<lg n="1" type="quatrain">
<l>At the end of the day at Almu,</l>

</lg>
<pb n="73"/>
<lg n="2" type="quatrain">
<l>Murchad parted from a coward.</l>
<l>He advanced champions on the earth;</l>

<lg n="4" type="quatrain">

</text></p>
<p>The fool &Uacute;a Maigl&eacute;ine was taken captive there, and he was asked 
to give a fool's shout, and he did; that shout was loud and melodious, so that 
the shout of &Uacute;a Maigl&eacute;ine has remained from that time with the 
fools of Ireland. Afterwards Fergal's head was cut off, and the fool's head was 
also cut off. The echo of the fool's shout was in the air for three days and 
three nights. This is the origin of the saying, <q>the shout of &Uacute;a 
Maigl&eacute;ine pursuing the men in the bog.</q></p>
<p>Then &Aacute;ed Laigen son of Fidchellach, king of &Uacute;&iacute; Maine 
Connacht, was defeated and fled, saying to his sons, <q>Do not leave me, sons; 
your mother will be better disposed towards you if you take me with you.</q> 
<q>They will not take you,</q> said the Laigin. It was then that &Aacute;ed 
Laigen, king of &Uacute;&iacute; Maine, was slain.</p>
<p>However, the sons of &Aacute;ed Laigen, in the company of &Aacute;ed 
All&aacute;in son of Fergal, reached Lilcach, where Modichu son of Amargein and 
the pious Foreigner were. It was then that the &Uacute;i N&eacute;ill and 
Connachta dug the rampart of the church, and they were in the guise of clergy, 
and it was thus that they were saved through a miracle of the saints, so that 
the friendship of the &Uacute;&iacute; N&eacute;ill and Connachta is in that 
church from that time forth; wherefore &Aacute;ed Ail&aacute;in sang:

<p>That day was triumphant for the Laigin. C&uacute; Bretan son of Congus, king 
of Fir Rois, was protected, however, on account of the verses he had made the 
evening before. The Laigin were in Condail of the Kings that night, drinking 
wine and mead cheerfully and happily after winning the battle, with each of them 
telling his exploits, and they were exhilarated and gloriously drunk. Murchad 
mac Brain said then, <q>I would give a chariot worth four  
<frn lang="ga">cumals</frn>, and my horse, and my trappings, to a warrior who would  
go into the battlefield and bring us a trophy from it.</q> 
<q>I will go,</q> said B&aacute;ethgalach, a Munster warrior. He put on his gear 
for battle and protection, and he went to the place where Fergal's body was, and 
he heard something, a proclamation in the air overhead, and it said for all to 
hear, <q>It has been commanded to you by the King of seven heavens: make music 
for your lord tonight, for Fergal son of M&aacute;el D&uacute;in; although all 
of your skilled people have fallen here, pipers and trumpeters and harpists, do 
not let terror or weakness prevent you from playing tonight for Fergal.</q> Then 
the warrior heard mournful piping and song; and he heard then in the clump of 
rushes next to him a war chanting that was sweeter than any music. The youth 
went towards it. 
<q>Do not come to me,</q> said the head to him. 
<q>Who are you?</q> asked the warrior. 
<q>I am the head of Donn B&oacute;,</q> replied the head, <q>and I was pledged 
last night to entertain the king tonight, so do not harm me.</q> 
<q>Where is Fergal's body here?</q> asked the warrior. 
<q>It shines out before you, yonder.</q> 
<q>Shall I take you with me?</q> asked the warrior. 
<q>I would like you most of all to take me,</q> said the head, <q>but let Christ 
be your surety that if you take me, you bring me back to my body again.</q> 
<q>I shall indeed,</q> said the youth.</p>
<p>And the youth returned to Condail with the head, and he found the Laigin 
drinking when he arrived the same night. <q>Have you brought a trophy with you?</q> 
asked Murchad. 
<q>I have,</q> said the warrior: <q>the head of Donn B&oacute;.</q> 
<q>Put it on that pillar over there,</q> said Murchad. The whole host recognized 
it as the head of Donn B&oacute;, and they all said, <q>Alas for you, Donn 
B&oacute;, your form was comely; entertain us tonight as you did your lord this 
morning.</q> His face was turned then, and his sorrowful chant rose on high, so 
that all were crying and lamenting. The same warrior brought the head back to 
its body, as he had promised, and he placed it on its neck. With that, Donn 
B&oacute; returned to his mother's house. For these were the three wonders of 
that battle: Donn B&oacute;'s returning alive 
 <pb n="77"/>
  
 
to his house according to the words of Colum Cille, and the fool &Uacute;a 
Maigl&eacute;ines shout remaining three days and three nights in the air, and 
the nine thousand who overthrew the twenty-one thousand. Whence was said:

<head>A third fragment, extracted by the same Mac Fir 
Bhisigh from the same manuscript, beginning from the fifth year of the reign of 
M&aacute;el Sechlainn son of M&aacute;el Ruanaid, or (as the Annals of Donegal 
have it) 849 A.D.</head>
<div2 n="FA 233">
<p><date value="851">851</date> Then as the sentinels of the 
Norwegians were looking attentively across the sea, they saw a vast sea-going 
fleet coming towards them. Great terror and fear seized them: but some of them 
were saying that it was Norwegians coming to reinforce and relieve them. Some 
others&mdash;and those understood better&mdash;said that it was Aunites, i.e. 
Danes, who were there, coming to destroy and plunder them; and that was more 
accurate. The Norwegians sent out a very fast ship to meet them to 
investigate.</p>
<p>Then the swift ship of the young man who was mentioned before came alone in 
front of the other ships, until the two ships met face to face, and the helmsman 
of the Norwegian ship said, <q>You, men,</q> he said, <q>from what country have 
you come onto this sea? Do you come for peace, or for war?</q> This is the 
answer that the Danes gave him: a great shower of arrows upon them. The crews of 
those two ships set to at once; the Danish ship overcame the Norwegian, and the 
Danes killed the crew of the 
 <pb n="91"/>
 
 
Norwegian ship. The Danes rushed all together against the Norwegians so that 
they reached the shore. They battled harshly, and the Danes killed three times 
their own number of them, and they beheaded everyone that they killed. The Danes 
brought the Norwegians' ships with them to port. Afterwards the Danes seized the 
women and gold and all the goods of the Norwegians, and thus the Lord took from 
them all the wealth they had taken from the churches and holy places and shrines 
of the saints of Ireland.</p>
</div2>
<div2 n="FA 234">
<p><date value="851">851</date> At that time M&aacute;el 
Sechlainn sent messengers for Cin&aacute;ed son of Conaing, king of 
Cianachta&mdash;and it was he who had burned the churches and the oratories of 
the saints (as we recounted before)&mdash;as if to consult with him as to what 
they should do about the matter of the Danes, for it seemed there was peace 
between M&aacute;el Sechlainn and Cin&aacute;ed; and although Cin&aacute;ed had 
an eye disease, he came to M&aacute;el Sechlainn, with an army about him as if 
to protect him.</p>
<p>M&aacute;el Sechlainn and Cin&aacute;ed and Tigernach, king of Brega, met 
together in one place. M&aacute;el Sechlainn desired that he and the king of 
Brega should kill the king of Cianachta. However, M&aacute;el Sechlainn did not 
do that immediately, because Cin&aacute;ed had an army, and he was afraid that 
there would be reciprocal slaughter. What he did was to postpone it until the 
morning of the next day. Then M&aacute;el Sechlainn devised false reasons for 
their coming to the same place the following day, and he ordered the armies to 
go away. When Cin&aacute;ed's army had left him, M&aacute;el Sechlainn came with 
a large host to Cin&aacute;ed, and it was not fully daylight then; and this is 
what M&aacute;el Sechlainn said in a loud and harsh and hostile voice to 
Cin&aacute;ed: <q>Why,</q> he said, <q>did you burn the oratories of the saints, 
and why did you, along with Norwegians, destroy their holy places and the books 
of the saints?</q></p>
<p>Then Cin&aacute;ed knew that fine words would not avail him, and he remained 
silent. That noble, well-born, strong youth was dragged out after that, and he 
was drowned in a dirty stream according to M&aacute;el Sechlainn's plan; and 
that was how he died.</p>
</div2>
<div2 n="FA 235">
<p><date value="852">852</date> In this year, that is, in the 
fifth year of M&aacute;el Sechlainn's reign, two chieftains of the Norwegian 
fleet, Zain and Iargna, mustered large armies from every place against the 
Danes. They assembled, then, so that there were seventy ships, and they went to 
Sn&aacute;m Aignech; and that was where the Danes were at that time. They drew 
together there and fought a hard and terrible battle on both sides; for we have 
never before heard anywhere 
 <pb n="93"/>
 
 
of a slaughter like that which took place between them there, that is, between 
the Danes and Norwegians. Nevertheless, it was the Danes who were defeated.</p>
<p>The Danes gathered together afterwards, after they had been routed, and they 
were dying of famine; and this is what their chieftain, Horm, said to them (and 
before then he had been a hard, triumphant man): 
<q>Until now,</q> he said, <q>you have won many victories, although you have 
been overcome here by a more numerous army. Listen to the words I will say to 
you: every victory and every triumph, and all the glory that you have gained 
thereby, that has been destroyed by a small bit of a single day. Look, then, to 
the next battle you would fight against the Norwegians, for they have your 
women, and all your wealth, and your ships, and they are gloating at having won 
victory and spoils from you. What you must do now is to go single-mindedly 
against them, as if you did not expect to live, but were not waiting for death 
either; and revenge yourselves. And though you may not have a lucky victory 
thereby, we will have what our gods and our fate will give to us; if it does not 
go well for us then, there will be general slaughter on both sides.  Here is another of my counsels to you: this Saint Patrick who is chief bishop and head of the saints of Ireland, against whom our enemies have committed many offenses: let us pray diligently to him, and let us give honorable offerings to him, to bring victory and triumph over those enemies.</q> 
All answered him, and this is what they said: <q>Let our protector,</q> they 
said, <q>be this Saint Patrick, and the Lord who is master to him, and let our 
spoils and our treasure be given to his church.</q></p>
<p>After that, they proceeded together single-mindedly, virile and manly, 
against the Norwegians, and gave battle.</p>
<p>At this time Zain, one of the two kings of the Norwegians, and Matud&aacute;n, 
king of Ulaid, came to ravage the Danes on sea and land; although Zain the 
Norwegian had not known about that before, he came, along with the small number 
who had accompanied him, to attack the Danes on one side, and Iargna, the other 
king of the Norwegians, came against the Danes from the other side. Then the 
battle was fought hard. The shrieking of the javelins, and the crashing blows of 
swords, and the hammering of shields being struck, and the cries of soldiers 
being overcome, were loudly audible. Though it lasted a long time, it was the 
Norwegians who were defeated, and the Danes took victory and spoils, by grace of 
Patrick, although the Norwegians were three or four times the number of the 
Danes.</p>
<p>Afterwards the Danes attacked the camp of the Norwegians, and killed some 
there, and took others captive, and put others to flight, and seized 
 <pb n="95"/>
 
 
all the wealth of gold and silver, and all other goods, and their women, and 
their ships. However, Zain himself was not fighting in this battle, for he did 
not come along with his people towards the camp, because he had been taking 
counsel in another place. When he came to the camp, it was the enemies he saw 
there, and not his own people.</p>
<p>Besides the Danes themselves who were killed, five thousand Norwegian men of 
good families were slain. Moreover, many other soldiers and men of every rank 
were killed in addition to those numbers.</p>
<p>It was at that time that M&aacute;el Sechlainn, king of Temair, sent 
messengers to the Danes. When they arrived the Danes were cooking, and the 
supports of the cooking-pots were heaps of the bodies of the Norwegians, and 
even the spits on which the meat was <sup resp="JR">roasting</sup> rested their ends on the bodies 
of Norwegians, and the fire was burning the bodies, so that the meat and fat 
that they had eaten the night before was bursting out of their bellies. The 
messengers of M&aacute;el Sechlainn were looking at them thus, and they were 
reproaching the Danes for it. This is what the Danes said: <q>They would like to 
have us like that.</q> They had a huge ditch full of gold and silver to give to 
Patrick. For the Danes were like that, and they had kinds of piety&mdash;that 
is, they abstained from meat and from women for a while, for the sake of 
piety.</p>
<p>Now this battle gave good spirits to all the Irish because of the destruction 
it brought upon the Norwegians.</p>

were looking at the slain around them, and they saw their own people being 
killed in the manner in which they slaughtered sheep. Great passion seized them, 
and what they did was to draw their swords and take their arms, and to attack 
the Osraige so that they killed many of them; nevertheless they were driven back 
in rout. At &Aacute;th Muiceda that defeat was given. Then trouble occurred for 
Cerball himself there; that is, when the defeat was accomplished, and he was 
separated from his attendants, a group of the Norwegians came to him and took 
him captive. But through the Lord's help he was aided: he himself tore his

<p>In the same year the men of Munster sent messengers to Cerball 
son of D&uacute;nlang, asking him to come with the Danes and the muster of Osraige to 
relieve and reinforce them against the Norse who were plundering and destroying them at that 
time. Now Cerball responded to that, and he commanded all the Danes and the Osraige to go to 
assist the men of Munster, and he was obeyed. Then Cerball proceeded against the 
Norwegians with a large army of Danes and Irish.</p>
<p>When the Norwegians saw Cerball with his army, or retinue, they were seized 
by terror and great fear. Cerball went to a high place, and he was talking to 
his own people at first. This is what he said, looking at the wasted lands 
around him: <q>Do you not see,</q> said he, <q>how the Norwegians have 
devastated this territory by taking its cattle and by killing its people? If 
they are stronger than we are today, they will do the same in our land. Since we 
are a large army today, let us fight hard against them. There is another reason 
why we must do hard fighting: that the Danes who are along with us may discover 
no cowardice or timidity in us. For it could happen, though they are on our side 
today, that they might be against us another day. Another reason is so that the 
men of Munster whom we have come to relieve may comprehend our hardiness, for 
they are often our enemies.</q></p>
<p>Afterwards he spoke to the Danes, and this is what he said to them: <q>Act 
valiantly today, for the Norwegians are your hereditary enemies, and have 
battled among you and made great massacres previously. You are fortunate that we 
are with you today against them. And one thing more: it will not be worth your 
while for us to see weakness or cowardice in you.</q></p>
<p>The Danes and the Irish all answered him that neither cowardice nor weakness 
would be seen in them. Then they rose up as one man to attack the Norwegians. 
Now the Norwegians, when they saw that, did not think of giving battle, but fled 
to the woods, abandoning their spoils. The woods were surrounded on all sides 
against them, and a bloody slaughter was made of the Norwegians. Until that time 
the Norwegians had not suffered the like anywhere in Ireland. This defeat 
occurred at Cruachan in E&oacute;ganacht. Cerball came back home with victory 
and spoils.</p>
<p>Horm and his people were escorted by Cerball to the king of Temair after 
that. The king of Temair welcomed him and gave him great honour. Then he went to 
sea. That Horm was killed later by Rhodri, king of the Britons.</p>

</div2>
<div2 n="FA 260">
<p><date value="858">858</date> Kl. In this year, the twelfth 
year of M&aacute;el Sechlainn's reign, M&aacute;el Sechlainn made a large hosting 
into Osraige and Munster, because the men of Munster had said that they would 
not give hostages to him; and that was why M&aacute;el Sechlainn declared war on 
them. And M&aacute;el Sechlainn had another important reason: Cerball son of 
D&uacute;nlang, king of Osraige, that man who was worthy to possess all Ireland  
because of the excellence of his form and his countenance and his dexterity, took  
great annual tributes from the Laigin territories that he possessed. However, the  
people who went to collect that tribute, i.e. the stewards of Cerball son of  
D&uacute;nlang, created great strife in collecting the tribute, and gave great  
insult to the Laigin. Therefore, the Laigin went complaining to M&aacute;el Sechlainn,  
and told this to him. M&aacute;el Sechlainn was seized by rage, and be brought a  
large muster against Cerball and the Munster men who were assisting Cerball.</p>
<p>M&aacute;el Sechlainn and his army then came to Gabr&aacute;n, and it was at 
the edge of Gabr&aacute;n that the other troops were. Although M&aacute;el 
Sechlainn's forces were more numerous, he did not attack them; instead they took 
a route other than that which was expected, till they reached Carn Lugdach, and 
there M&aacute;el Sechlainn was armed and equipped against all. When the men of 
Munster saw that, they left their camp and divided their army in two, and the 
king of Munster, M&aacute;el Guala, came against M&aacute;el Sechlainn with many 
horsemen. Cerball and his Danes&mdash;those left of Horm's followers who 
remained with Cerball&mdash;had their encampment in a brambly, dense, entangled 
wood, and Cerball had a great muster there about him. The learned related that 
Cerball had great difficulty there because Tairceltach mac na Certa practised 
magic upon him, so that it might be less likely that he should go to the battle; 
so Cerball said that he would go to sleep then, and would not go to the battle.</p>
<p>The troop which included the king of Munster overcame M&aacute;el Sechlainn's 
men at first. Then his foot-soldiers came up to relieve him (i.e. <sup resp="JR">to relieve</sup> 
M&aacute;el Sechlainn and his followers), and they routed the men of Munster and 
massacred them. Many of their freemen were slain there. The learned relate that 
the number of the defeated army was twenty thousand.</p>
<pb n="105"/>
<p>When Cerball heard of that, he decided that hostages should be given to 
M&aacute;el Sechlainn so that his territory would not be devastated; and 
M&aacute;el Sechlainn accepted hostages from him. For Land, daughter of 
D&uacute;nlang, sister of Cerball, was the wife of M&aacute;el Sechlainn.</p>
<p>M&aacute;el Sechlainn went to Munster, and he was at Imlech for a month, 
raiding Munster, so that he took the hostages of Munster from Comar Tr&iacute; 
n-Uisce to Inis Tarbna in the west of Ireland. That was the battle of Carn 
Lugdach. In that battle M&aacute;el Cr&oacute;in son of Muiredach, one of the 
two kings of the D&eacute;issi, was killed. Although M&aacute;el Sechlainn did 
not make this expedition to take the kingship of Munster for himself, it was 
worth coming in order to kill those <term lang="ga">Gall-Gaedil</term> who were slain there, for they 
were men who had forsaken their baptism, and they used to be called Norsemen, 
for they had the customs of the Norse, and had been fostered by them, and though 
the original Norsemen were evil to the churches, these were much worse, these 
people, wherever in Ireland they were.</p>

<p><date value="860">860</date> The men from two fleets of 
Norsemen came into Cerball son of D&uacute;nlang's territory for plunder. 
When messengers came to tell that to Cerball, he was drunk. The noblemen of 
Osraige were saying to him kindly and calmly, to strengthen him: <q>What the 
Norwegians are doing now, that is, destroying the whole country, is no reason 
for a man in Osraige to be drunk. But may God protect you all the same, and may 
you win victory and triumph over your enemies as you often have done, and as you 
still shall. Shake off your drunkenness now, for drunkenness is the enemy of 
valor.</q></p>
<p>When Cerball heard that, his drunkenness left him and he seized his arms. A 
third of the night had passed at that time. This is how Cerball came out of his 
chamber: with a huge royal candle before him, and the light of that candle shone 
far in every direction. Great terror seized the Norwegians, and they fled to the 
nearby mountains and to the woods. Those who stayed behind out of valor, 
moreover, were all killed.</p>
<p>When daybreak came the next morning, Cerball attacked all of them with his 
troops, and he did not give up after they had been slaughtered until they had 
been routed, and they had scattered in all directions. Cerball himself fought 
hard in this battle, and the amount he had drunk the night before hampered him 
greatly, and he vomited much, and that gave him immense strength; and he urged 
his people loudly and harshly against the Norwegians, and more than half of the 
army was killed there, and those who escaped fled to their ships. This defeat 
took place at Achad mic Erclaige. Cerball turned back afterwards with triumph 
and great spoils.</p>
</div2>
<div2 n="FA 278">
<p>At that time came Hona and Tomrir Torra, two noble chieftains, and this 
Hona was a druid; and they were brave, hard men of great renown among their own people; 
moreover they were of fully noble stock of the great race of Norway. That pair then proceeded 
with their troops to Luimnech, and from Luimnech to Port L&aacute;irge. Nevertheless they 
relied more on their own strength than on the troops. The E&oacute;ganachta and 
Araid Cliach mustered against them, and they met face to face, and there was 
hard fighting between them, with the result that they drove the Norwegians into 
a small place with strong fortification around it. Then the druid, Hona, who was 
the elder of them, went up onto the rampart with his mouth open, praying to his 
gods and doing his druidry, and urging his people to worship the gods. One of 
the Munster men came up to him and gave him a blow across the jaw with a large 
stone, and knocked all of his teeth out of his head. He turned then to face his own 
 <pb n="111"/>
 
 
people, and this is what he said as the hot blood poured out of his mouth: 
<q>I shall die of this,</q> he said; and he fell backwards and his life went out 
of him. They were attacked with stones after that, until they could not stand 
it, but left that place, and went into the nearest marsh, and the other 
chieftain was killed there; and that was how they slew the two chieftains, Hona 
of Luimnech and Tomrir Torra. Only two of their noblemen escaped, and a small 
number with them; and thus the men of Munster won victory and triumph.</p>

<p><date value="860">860</date> In this year M&aacute;el

afraid that &Aacute;ed son of Niall would attack his encampment, despite the 
promise of peace that &Aacute;ed had given him through the holy man Fethgna, 
successor of Patrick.</p>
<p>This is what M&aacute;el Sechlainn did: he stationed around his tent the 
Laigin and the Munstermen and the Connachtmen and the Ulaid and the men of 
Brega, with their weapons naked in their hands. The king himself, i.e. 
M&aacute;el Sechlainn, stayed watchful and wary and sleepless for fear of 
&Aacute;ed, although he had given an oath in the presence of the successor of 
Patrick. Nevertheless &Aacute;ed came with his forces to attack M&aacute;el 
Sechlainn's encampment, and they did not find it as they had expected it, for 
M&aacute;el Sechlainn's army had all their weapons in their hands, and they rose 
up together against the people who had come to attack them, so that they routed 
them after slaughtering them.</p>
<p>Then madness seized a certain band of them, and they came to M&aacute;el 
Sechlainn's tents, thinking that they were those of their own people. They were 
there until they were all killed&mdash;and it was on account of the false oath 
they had taken that God did that. M&aacute;el Sechlainn returned home after that 
victory. Moreover, Amlaib was along with &Aacute;ed in this defeat.</p>

<p><date value="866">866</date> In this year &Aacute;ed son of 
Niall, king of Ireland, massacred the Norwegians and harried them all. 
&Aacute;ed had a great victory over the Norwegians at Loch Febail. The learned 
related that it was his wife who most incited &Aacute;ed against the 
Norwegians&mdash;namely Land, daughter of D&uacute;nlang: and she was the one 
who was M&aacute;el Sechlainn's wife previously, and the mother of M&aacute;el 
Sechlainn's son, i.e. Flann. She was the mother of Cenn&eacute;tig son of 
G&aacute;eth&iacute;ne, king of Lo&iacute;ches. Now the ills that the Norwegians 
suffered this year are noteworthy, but the greatest they encountered were from 
&Aacute;ed Findliath son of Niall.</p>

<div2 n="FA 330">
<p><date value="867">867</date> At this time came the Aunites 
(that is, the Danes) with innumerable armies to York, and they sacked the city, 
and they overcame it; and that was the beginning of harassment and misfortunes 
for the Britons; for it was not long before this that there had been every war 
and every trouble in Norway, and this was the source of that war in Norway: two 
younger sons of Albdan, king of Norway, drove out the eldest son, i.e. Ragnall 
son of Albdan, for fear that he would seize the kingship of Norway after their 
father. So Ragnall came with his three sons to the Orkneys. Ragnall stayed there 
then, with his youngest son. The older sons, however, filled with arrogance and 
rashness, proceeded with a large army, having mustered that army from all 
quarters, to march against the Franks and Saxons. They thought that their father 
would return to Norway immediately after their departure.</p>
<p>Then their arrogance and their youthfulness incited them to voyage across the 
Cantabrian Ocean (i.e. the sea that is between Ireland and Spain) and they 
reached Spain, and they did many evil things in Spain, both destroying and 
plundering. After that they proceeded across the Gaditanean Straits (i.e. the 
place where the Irish Sea <sup resp="JR">sic</sup> goes into the surrounding 
 <pb n="121"/>
 
 
ocean), so that they reached Africa, and they waged war against the 
Mauritanians, and made a great slaughter of the Mauritanians. However, as they 
were going to this battle, one of the sons said to the other, <q>Brother,</q> he 
said, <q>we are very foolish and mad to be killing ourselves going from country 
to country throughout the world, and not to be defending our own patrimony, and 
doing the will of our father, for he is alone now, sad and discouraged in a land 
not his own, since the other son whom we left along with him has been slain, as 
has been revealed to me.</q> It would seem that that was revealed to him in a 
dream vision; and his <sup resp="JR">Ragnall's</sup> other son was slain in battle; and moreover, 
the father himself barely escaped from that battle&mdash;which dream proved to 
be true.</p>
<p>While he was saying that, they saw the Mauritanian forces coming towards 
them, and when the son who spoke the above words saw that, he leaped suddenly 
into the battle, and attacked the king of the Mauritanians, and gave bim a blow 
with a great sword and cut off his hand. There was hard fighting on both sides 
in this battle, and neither of them won the victory from the other in that 
battle. But all returned to camp, after many among them had been slain. However, 
they challenged each other to come to battle the next day.</p>
<p>The king of the Mauritanians escaped from the camp and fled in the night 
after his hand had been cut off. When the morning came, the Norwegians seized 
their weapons and readied themselves firmly and bravely for the battle. The 
Mauritanians, however, when they noticed that their king had departed, fled 
after they had been terribly slain. Thereupon the Norwegians swept across the 
country, and they devastated and burned the whole land. Then they brought a 
great host of them captive with them to Ireland, i.e. those are the black men. 
For <frn lang="la">Mauri</frn> is the same as <frn lang="la">nigri</frn>; 
'Mauritania' is the same as <frn lang="la">nigritudo</frn>. Hardly one in three 
of the Norwegians escaped, between those who were slain, and those who drowned 
in the Gaditanian Straits. Now those black men remained in Ireland for a long 
time. Mauritania is located across from the Balearic Islands.</p>

<p><date value="866">866</date> In this year Earl Tomrar came 
from Luimnech to Cluain Ferta (he was a very strong, very rough, merciless man 
of the Norwegians), thinking to take great spoils in that church. However, he 
did not get what he expected, because a warning arrived a little while ahead of 
him, and the people fled promptly before him in boats, and some others into the 
marshes, others into the church. Those whom he found in the enclosure and in the 
graveyard he killed. Now Cormac son of &Eacute;l&oacute;thach, learned sage of 
Ireland, successor of Sen-Chiar&aacute;n of Saigir, was in that church. Thus God 
and Br&eacute;naind saved them. That Tomrar, moreover, died of insanity within a 
year, Br&eacute;naind having performed a miracle upon him.</p>
</div2>
<div2 n="FA 338">
<p><sup resp="JR">?866</sup> In that year the Norwegian 
kings went into Munster with huge armies, and they plundered Munster severely; 
all the same, they were badly defeated there. For Cenn&eacute;tig son of 
G&aacute;eth&iacute;ne, king of Lo&iacute;ches, came. (He was a son of Land, 
daughter of D&uacute;nlang, who was also the mother of Flann son of M&aacute;el 
Sechlainn, and she was then the wife of &Aacute;ed son of Niall, king of 
Temair.) This son of G&aacute;eth&iacute;ne was the most savage and triumphant 
man against the foreigners in Ireland at this time. This Cenn&eacute;tig came, 
then, with the Lo&iacute;chsi and many of the Osraige along with him, to the 
encampment of the Norwegians, and they slaughtered their noblemen in the middle 
of the camp. It was then that Cenn&eacute;tig saw one of his own people, with 
two Norwegians trying to cut off his head, and he came quickly to save him, and 
he beheaded those two men and saved his own attendant. Cenn&eacute;tig proceeded 
with victory and triumph.</p>
<p>Then the raiding party of Norwegians, which had great spoils, attacked 
Cenn&eacute;tig. When they had heard those noblemen being slain, they had left 
their raid and their booty, and had come hard and actively against Cenn&eacute;tig. 
Foreign, barbarous cries were raised there, and <sup resp="JR">the noise of</sup> 
many war trumpets, and a crowd were saying <q>N&uacute;i, n&uacute;!</q> Then 
many arrows were loosed between them, and short spears, and finally they took to 
their heavy and hard-smiting swords. Nevertheless, God was helping the son of 
G&aacute;eth&iacute;ne and his troops; the Norwegians were overcome, and left 
the place of battle; they went in rout after their bloody defeat.</p>
<p>A certain group did not flee far away because of their weakness&mdash;having 
suffered great famine&mdash;or because they were ashamed to run away. When they 
saw the army of the son of G&aacute;eth&iacute;ne gathering up the riches that 
they had abandoned, they came after them. When the son of G&aacute;eth&iacute;ne 
 <pb n="125"/>
 
 
saw that, he charged at them as a wolf attacks sheep, and they fled into 
the bog and were all killed in the bog, and dogs devoured their corpses.</p>
<p>Then these people, the son of G&aacute;eth&iacute;ne and his party, made a 
great slaughter of the noblemen of the Norwegian king in another place in 
Munster&mdash;that is, of the horsetroops of the Norwegian king. In revenge the 
Norwegians killed a great host of clerics who were ... themselves, but this was 
after unction and penance.</p>
</div2>
<div2 n="FA 339">
<p> At that time M&aacute;el Ciar&aacute;in gained great fame among 
the Irish from his frequent victories over the Norwegians.</p>
</div2>
<div2 n="FA 340">
<p><date value="866">866</date> In this year Earl Tomrar, the 
enemy of Br&eacute;naind, died of insanity at Port Manann, and he could see 
Br&eacute;naind killing him.</p>
</div2>
<div2 n="FA 341">
<p>At this time the Ciarraige besieged the followers of that Tomrar, 
and since they had prayed to Br&eacute;naind at the edge of the sea, the Lord was helping 
the Irish: for the sea was drowning the Norwegians, and the Ciarraige were slaying them. 
Old Congal, king of the Ciarraige, took the victory in this conflict. A few of the 
Norwegians escaped, naked and wounded; great quantities of gold and silver and 
beautiful women were left behind.</p>
</div2>
<div2 n="FA 342">
<p>In this year, moreover, Norwegian forces came from the port of Corcach 
to plunder Fir Maige F&eacute;ine, but God did not allow them to do that. For at that time, 
the D&eacute;issi came raiding into the same territory, by God's providence, since the 
D&eacute;issi and the Fir Maige were bitter enemies before then. When the D&eacute;issi 
saw the Norwegians plundering and devastating the land, they came to the Fir Maige, and 
they made a firm and lasting peace, and together they attacked the Norwegians 
fiercely and actively and pugnaciously, and there was hard and vigorous fighting 
between them on both sides. Nevertheless the Norwegians were defeated, by a 
miracle of the Lord, and they were slaughtered.</p>
<p>However, their leader, whose name was Gn&iacute;m Cinnsiolaigh, fled until he 
reached a strong castle that was near them, and he attempted to take it, but in 
vain, since he could not stand the number of javelins and stones that were being 
cast at him. What he did was to summon Cenn F&aacute;elad to him, because he 
thought that he was an ally, and he promised him many presents in exchange for 
protecting him; but this availed him nothing, for he was dragged out, at the 
entreaty of the multitude who had served him before, and he was miserably 
killed, and all his followers were slain. Shortly after that, moreover, people 
came to the castle in which he had passed his life lustfully, and it was totally 
demolished. Thus it pleased God.</p>

</div2>
<div2 n="FA 347">
<p><date value="867">867</date> There was an encounter between 
&Oacute;isle, son of the king of Norway, and Amlaib, his brother. The king had 
three sons: Amlaib, Imar, and &Oacute;isle. &Oacute;isle was the least of them 
in age, but he was the greatest in valor, for he outshone the Irish in casting 
javelins and in strength with spears. He outshone the Norwegians in strength 
with swords and in shooting arrows. His brothers loathed him greatly, and Amlaib 
the most; the causes of the hatred are not told because of their length. The two 
brothers, Amlaib and Imar, went to consult about the matter of the young lad 
&Oacute;isle; although they had hidden reasons for killing him, they did not 
bring these up, but instead they brought up other causes for which they ought to 
kill him; and afterwards they decided to kill him.</p>
<p>When Amlaib learned that the party of the brother he hated had arrived, what 
he did was to send trusted messengers for the strongest and most vigorous 
horsemen he had, that they might be in the house to meet &Oacute;isle. Then 
&Oacute;isle came, the handsomest and bravest man in the world at that time; now 
he came into his brother's house with few attendants, for he did not expect what 
he found there (i.e. to be killed). What he sought there, moreover, was 
something that he did not expect to get. First he asked that liberty of speech 
be given him. That was granted. This is what he said: <q>Brother,</q> he said, 
<q>if your wife, i.e. the daughter of Cin&aacute;ed, does not love you, why not 
give her to me, and whatever you have lost by her, I shall give to you.</q></p>
<p>When Amlaib heard that, he was seized with great jealousy, and he drew his 
sword, and struck it into the head of &Oacute;isle, his brother, so that he 
killed him. After that all rose up to fight each other (i.e. the followers of 
the king, Amlaib, and the followers of the brother who had been killed there); 
then there were trumpets and battle-cries on both sides. After that the camp of 
the slain brother was attacked, his followers having been slaughtered. There 
were many spoils in that camp.</p>
</div2>
<pb n="129"/>
<div2 n="FA 348">
<p><date value="867">867</date> In this year the Danes went to 
York, and battled hard with the Saxons there. The Saxons were defeated, and the 
king of the Saxons, i.e., Aelle, was slain there through the deceit and 
treachery of a young lad of his own household. There was great slaughter in that 
battle, and afterwards York was attacked, and much of every kind of booty was 
taken from it&mdash; for it was rich at that time&mdash;and the noblemen who 
were captured there were put to death. It was from that that every misfortune 
and every harassment of the island of Britain arose.</p>
</div2>
<div2 n="FA 349">
<p><date value="867">867</date> In this year the famous 
Cenn&eacute;tig (i.e. the son of G&aacute;eth&iacute;ne), renowned enemy of the 
Norwegians, came to attack the encampment of Amlaib, king of the Norwegians (and 
it was he above who killed his brother), and he burned it ... The Norwegians 
came after him, and when he turned to face them, he drove them in defeat back to 
the same camp, and slaughtered their noblemen. Thus it pleased God.</p>
</div2>
<div2 n="FA 350">
<p>In this year, moreover, Earl B&aacute;rith and H&aacute;imar, two men 
of a noble family of the Norwegians, came through the center of Connacht towards Luimnech, 
as if they would do nothing to the Connachtmen. Nevertheless, that was not how it happened, 
for they trusted not in numbers, but rather in their own strength. The Connachtmen 
proceeded to overcome them by ambush; for at that time there happened to be a 
certain Munster man among them strong and hard and clever in the use of weapons,  
and that Munster man, moreover, was clever at making plans. The Connachtmen asked  
him to go to the Norwegians, as if he were going to guide them, and to kill  
B&aacute;rith.</p>
<p>When he came to the place where H&aacute;imar was, he stabbed H&aacute;imar  
forcefully with a javelin, and he killed him. But a Connacht soldier who accompanied  
him in order to kill B&aacute;rith did not happen to do as he desired, for he was  
wounded in his thigh, and he barely escaped afterwards. Then the Connachtmen attacked the 
Norwegians and slaughtered the Norwegians, but it would not have been thus if the woods and 
the night had not been near. They returned afterwards to the place from which they had come, 
and did not go to Luimnech.</p>

<p><date value="868">868</date> In this year, moreover, 
&Aacute;ed Findliath son of Niall, king of Ireland, made a vast hosting to 
devastate and plunder Cianachta; for the king of 
 <pb n="133"/>
 
 
Cianachta, Flann son of Conaing, the son of his own sister, had given great 
insult to the king of Ireland. Now there was no one in all Ireland with greater 
honour or kindness than this Flann, and although &Aacute;ed was not grateful to 
him at the time when &Aacute;ed was the High King of Ireland, Flann had served 
him well when he needed it, that is, when there had been war between him and 
M&aacute;el Sechlainn son of M&aacute;el Ruanaid: for it was on that account 
that M&aacute;el Sechlainn had driven Flann out of his territory. 
However, when Flann son of Conaing gave this insult to the king of Ireland, 
Land, daughter of the king of Osraige (i.e. D&uacute;nlang)&mdash;and she was 
wife to &Aacute;ed Findliath at that time, having previously been M&aacute;el 
Sechlainn's wife, and it was she who bore Flann <sup resp="JR">Sinna</sup> to him, truly the best 
lad in Ireland in his time, and he was High King of Ireland later; this same 
Land was mother of the famous Cenn&eacute;tig son of 
G&aacute;eth&iacute;ne&mdash;it was then, I say, that this queen was building a 
church to St. Brigit at Cell Dara, and she had many carpenters in the wood 
chopping down and shaping trees. This queen had heard the conversation and 
wishes of the Laigin concerning her husband, &Aacute;ed Findliath, and 
concerning her son, Flann son of M&aacute;el Sechlainn (and at that time there 
had never been another youth with his fame and his distinction), and when she 
found out that the Laigin were mustering with Flann son of Conaing, king of 
Cianachta, she went to where her husband was, and told that to him, and mightily 
incited him to gather forces against them.</p>
<p>Consequently, &Aacute;ed sent his army through Cianachta, and they plundered 
and burned, and killed people with much slaughter. Flann did not come 
immediately to attack them, however, for there was a great fleet at the mouth of 
the B&oacute;and at that time, and he sent to them to request that they come to 
help him, and they came accordingly, and then the Laigin came to help Flann. 
They all pursued the King of Ireland, with his booty ahead of him. &Aacute;ed 
climbed a height and surveyed the great host that was following him ... he and 
his advisers <sup resp="JR">said</sup>, <q>It is not by the number of warriors that a battle is 
won, but by the help of God and by the righteousness of a sovereign. Arrogance 
and excessive size of an army, moreover, are not what God values, but rather 
humble bearing and firmness of heart. Now these people have a multitude, and 
they advance arrogantly. All of you assemble around me now, and do not think of 
flight, for you are far from your own homes, and it will not be friends who will 
pursue you, and it will not be protection or mercy that you will receive. Do now 
as your fathers and grandfathers did: endure volleys discharged at you, in the 
name of the Trinity. When you see me rising, rise, all of you, together against 
them, as God will guide you.</q> Monday was the day of the week.</p>
<p>Now, this is what Flann son of Conaing on the other side said to his 
 <pb n="135"/>
 
 
people: <q>The people yonder are few in number, and we are many, so 
harden your steps against them.</q></p>
<p>And he made them into three divisions, he himself in front, and the Laigin 
next, and the Norwegians last; and he was telling them all, <q>Those people 
yonder will fall by you,</q> he said, <q>and you will have victory and triumph 
over them, for they will not think it proper to flee before you, and you are the 
greater number; for I am not in this battle for any other reason than to seize 
the kingship of Temair, or to be killed in fighting for it.</q> Those three 
divisions were indeed most lovely; there were many beautiful multi-colored 
banners there, and shields of all colors. Then they came in that manner to 
attack the King of Ireland.</p>
<p>The king of Ireland, however, was preparing for them, and he had six banners, 
the Lord's cross, and the staff of Jesus. Now when the enemy troops came near 
&Aacute;ed, he placed and he arranged around him the king of Ulaid on one side, 
and the king of Mide on the other side, and he said to them: <q>Do not think of 
flight, but trust in the Lord who gives victory to the Christians; let your 
thoughts be not womanish, but manly, and rout your enemies at once so that your 
fame may last forever.</q> They all replied that they would do so.</p>
<p>The King of Ireland had not finished saying the last of those words when 
their enemies came near, and first they loosed vast showers of arrows and 
afterwards showers of spears, and the third shower was of javelins, so that the 
King rose against them with his followers, and they fought bravely against them. 
(Unfortunately I do not find in the old book that is broken all of the exploits 
that everyone performed in this battle of Cell &uacute;a n-Daigre, nor the fine 
words that the King of Ireland spoke throughout to direct his own people; though 
I have the fact that the King defeated his enemies.)</p>
<p>And then the King said (when his troops had accomplished the defeat): 
Beloved people, spare the Christians, and attack the idolators, since they are 
fleeing before you. It was not futile for him to say that, for they did attack 
them, so that not more than a quarter of them escaped unhurt. All of the Laigin 
escaped to their own homeland, for they had formed themselves into a firm 
battle-line, shoulder to shoulder, on the advice of their prudent leader, 
M&aacute;el Ciar&aacute;in son of R&oacute;n&aacute;n. Flann son of Conaing fled 
with his troops, however, and the King's people caught up with him and beheaded 
him, and brought his head to the King's assembly place. And the King lamented 
over it then, although everyone was telling him that it was not right to mourn 
it simply because of the nearness of their kinship, and for other reasons which 
I cannot get out of the old book, etc.</p>

<p><sup resp="JR">?869</sup> Kl. In this year, the eighth 
year of the reign of &Aacute;ed Findliath, the Laigin drove away one of their 
chieftains, because they hated him&mdash;that is, they were jealous of him on 
account of the victories he had won over the Norwegians&mdash;or because they 
regarded him as an interloper, for he was of the stock of the Ciarraige Luachra; 
or else they hated him because of his arrogance. Because he could not be at the 
head of the noblemen of the Laigin, and king of the Laigin, he came with his 
followers to the King of Ireland, after he had been banished, and on account of 
his renowned valor the King received him with honor and gave his daughter, 
Eithne, to him as wife.</p>
<p>So great, moreover, was the power and the strength that he exercised over the 
Norwegians that they did not dare do any servile work on Sundays. It would be an 
impressive story to relate all the tributes that they used to pay to him 
... It was from envy and jealousy that the Laigin drove him away from themselves, 
and moreover, because he was of the men of Munster. Afterwards he came with 
troops to the Laigin, and he

made many raids and devastations and burnings and slayings among them. However, 
it is among the provisions of the saints that it will not be easy for him who is 
banished by the Laigin to come back to make war among them again, that it will 
not be easy for him ...  <sup resp="JR">they ignored</sup> fairness of men and of combat against 
him, but hacked at him from all sides with spears and battle-axes and swords, so 
that they made little pieces of him, and his head was struck off. Then all of 
his followers were killed. His head was later brought to the Norwegians, and 
they stuck it on a pole, and took turns shooting at it, and afterwards they 
threw it into the sea.</p>

<div2 n="FA 387">
<p><date value="870">870</date> In this year &Aacute;ed son of 
Niall came into Leinster, perhaps to avenge the warrior we mentioned above, who 
was killed by the Laigin, or perhaps to levy tribute. He plundered Leinster from 
&Aacute;th Cliath to Gabr&aacute;n. Then Cerball son of D&uacute;nlang, king of 
Osraige, and Cenn&eacute;tig son of G&aacute;eth&iacute;ne, king of 
Lo&iacute;ches, came from the other side of Leinster, and they did as much 
burning and plundering and killing as they could until they reached D&uacute;n 
m-Bolg, and they camped there (i.e., Cerball and Cenn&eacute;tig).</p>
<p>Then the Laigin mustered about their king, that is, about Muiredach son 
of Br&oacute;en, and he was a harsh, triumphant, clever king, for he had been 
for a long time in exile in Alba, and he was by nature hard and brave; and they 
decided that they should attack the Lo&iacute;chsi and Osraige who were in 
D&uacute;n m-Bolg, rather than the king of Ireland who was at Belach 
Gabr&aacute;in, and that they should attack the encampment at night. Thus the 
Laigin went, with their king along with them, hardily and bravely in their 
battle ranks to D&uacute;n m-Bolg, where their enemies were. Rough was their 
strength; the human condition is strange, for the Laigin trusted in St. Brigit 
that they would have victory and triumph over the Osraige and Lo&iacute;chsi. 
However, the Osraige trusted in St. Ciar&aacute;n of Saigir to bring them 
victory and triumph over the Laigin. The Laigin were praying fervently to St. 
Brigit that they might kill their enemies ...</p>
<p>Then the Laigin came to the side of the encampment where the son of 
G&aacute;eth&iacute;ne was. The son of G&aacute;eth&iacute;ne did not evade 
them, but attacked them harshly and fiercely, as was his custom. Then there was 
hard and bloody fighting on both sides. For a long time there were heard the 
cries of men driving each other to distress, and the clamour of the war 
trumpets; and the earth began to shake so that their horses and pack animals ran 
mad, and that was a great impediment to the actions of the warriors. 
Nevertheless, those of the army who were in the clefts of the rocks went after 
the pack animals and stopped many of them. That tumult was great, and great also 
was the noise in the air above them. While they were about that, Cerball was 
instructing his people, for it was the beginning of night, 
 <pb n="143"/>
  
 
and he said, <q>No matter from what direction the enemies approach you, let none 
of you move from his battle position; and maintain yourselves firmly against the 
enemies.</q></p>
<p>Cerball went with a troop to his sister's son, Cenn&eacute;tig, who was in 
great difficulty among his enemies, and he raised his harsh voice on high and 
was encouraging his people against the Laigin (and the Laigin heard that), and 
then his people were supporting him. He <sup resp="JR">Cerball</sup> appointed two of his men to 
guard and protect him. The king of Laigin cast a javelin at them and killed one 
of those two men, Folachtach, the <frn lang="ga">secnab</frn> of Cell Dara. 
Great was the tumult and commotion between them then, and the Badb raised her 
head among them, and there was much slaughter among them everywhere. Then the 
Laigin left the encampment, and they were taking their king with them, and since 
the king could not hold his army with him, he leaped on his horse and followed 
after his people. We are sure that it was by a miracle of St. Brigit and 
Sen-Chiar&aacute;n that they separated like that, for although noblemen among 
them were slain, there was no great massacre there. Neither Cerball nor 
Cenn&eacute;tig allowed his people to pursue the Laigin, through caution. On the 
next day many of the Laigin who had gone astray were killed.</p>
<p>Cerball and Cenn&eacute;tig came in tight, orderly battalions through the 
midst of their enemies to Gabr&aacute;n, to the King of Ireland, &Aacute;ed 
Findliath (whose wife was Cerball's sister, and mother of Cenn&eacute;tig), and 
they told the King of Ireland what had happened with them, that is, that their 
camp had been taken, etc. They had a friendly conversation, and they parted 
after that.</p>
<p>The king of the Laigin gave no good response to the King of Ireland, but 
he reminded him of what had been done to him, and he gave neither 
<sup resp="JR">tribute</sup> nor hostages.</p>

</div2>
<div2 n="FA 423">
<p><date value="908">908</date> <frn lang="la">Anno Domini</frn> 900. A great army of the men of Munster was gathered by the same two men, that is, by Flaithbertach 
and Cormac, to demand the hostages of the Laigin and Osraige, and the men of 
Munster were all in the same camp. Flaithbertach happened to ride along a street 
of the camp on his horse; his horse fell into a deep ditch under him, and that 
was an evil omen for him. There were many of his own people, and of the whole 
army, who did not wish to go on the expedition after that, for it seemed to all 
of them that this fall of the holy man was a calamitous omen.</p>
<p>Then noble messengers came from the Laigin, from Cerball son of 
Muirec&aacute;n, to Cormac first, and they delivered a message of peace on 
behalf of those of the Laigin who appeared to him (?): i.e., that there would be 
one peace in all of Ireland until the next B&eacute;ltaine (for it was a 
fortnight into autumn at that time), and hostages would be given into the 
keeping 
 <pb n="153"/>
 
 
of M&oacute;enach, the holy, wise and pious man, and other pious people; many 
goods and treasures would be given to Flaithbertach and to Cormac.</p>
<p>The peace offered him was most welcome to Cormac, and he came to tell 
Flaithbertach about it, and he told it to him as it had been brought him from 
the Laigin. When Flaithbertach heard that, he was greatly horrified, and he 
said, <q>This demonstrates,</q> he said, <q>your lack of spirit and the meanness 
of your descent, for you are the son of an outsider</q>&mdash;and he said many 
bitter and insulting words that it would be tedious to relate.</p>
<p>This is the reply that Cormac gave him: <q>I am certain,</q> said Cormac, 
<q>of what will result from that&mdash;that is, from giving battle&mdash;holy 
man,</q> said he. <q>Cormac will be cursed for it, and it is likely that you 
will die.</q> And when he had said that, he came to his own tent, tired and 
sorrowful, and when he had seated himself, he took a bucket of apples that was 
brought to him, and he was distributing them to his followers and he said, 
<q>Beloved people,</q> said he, <q>I shall never bestow apples upon you from 
this time forward.</q> <q>Is it so, dear earthly lord?</q> asked his people. 
<q>Why have you made us sad and sorrowful? You have often made evil prophecies for us.</q> 
He said then, <q>Indeed, beloved people, what sorrowful thing have I said? 
For it is small wonder that I should not give you apples from my own hand, since 
there will be some one among you after me who will distribute apples to you.</q></p>
<p>Afterwards he ordered a watch. There was summoned to him then the wise, pious 
man, the exalted successor of Comgall, and he made his confession and his will 
in his presence, and he received the Body of Christ from his hand, and he 
renounced life in the presence of this M&oacute;enach, for he knew that he would 
be killed in the battle, but he did not wish many to know this about him. He 
asked that his body be brought to Cluain Uama, if possible, but if it was not, 
that it be brought to the burial ground of Diarmait grandson of &Aacute;ed 
R&oacute;n, where he had studied for a long time. He greatly desired, however, 
to be buried at Cluain Uama of the son of L&eacute;n&iacute;ne. M&oacute;enach, 
however, preferred to bury him at D&iacute;sert Diarmata, for D&iacute;sert 
Diarmata was one of Comgall's places, and M&oacute;enach was successor of 
Comgall. M&oacute;enach son of Siadal was the wisest man in his time, and he 
worked hard then to make peace between the Laigin and the men of Munster, if 
possible. Many of the army of Munster deserted without leave.</p>
<p>Now there was great clamor and commotion in the encampment of the men of 
Munster at that time, for they heard that Flann son of M&aacute;el Sechlainn was 
in the Laigin camp with a huge army of foot and horse. Then M&oacute;enach said, 
<q>Nobles of Munster,</q> said he, <q>it would be right 
 <pb n="155"/>
 
 
for you to give the well-born hostages that I have brought you into the 
keeping of pious men until B&eacute;ltaine, i.e. the son of Cerball, king of the 
Laigin, and the son of the king of Osraige.</q> All the men of Munster were 
saying that it was Flaithbertach son of Inmain&eacute;n alone who compelled them 
to go into Leinster.</p>
<p>After the great complaint that they made, they came across Sl&iacute;ab 
Mairge from the west to Droichet Lethglinne. However, Tipraite, successor of 
Ailbe, and many clerics along with him stayed at Lethglenn, and also the 
servants of the army and their pack horses.</p>
<p>Then the men of Munster sounded trumpets and battlecries, and proceeded to 
Mag Ailbe. They were waiting for their enemies with their backs to a dense wood. 
The men of Munster formed themselves into three equally large, equally extensive 
battalions: Flaithbertach son of Inmain&eacute;n and Cellach son of Cerball, 
king of Osraige, leading the first battalion; Cormac son of Cuilenn&aacute;n, 
the king of Munster, leading the middle Munster battalion; Cormac son of Mothla, 
king of the D&eacute;issi, and the king of Ciarraige, and kings of many other 
tribes of West Munster in the third battalion. Then they proceeded like that 
over Mag Ailbe. They were complaining about the number of their enemies and the 
smallness of their own forces. This is what the wise men (i.e., the people who 
were among them) reported: that the Laigin with their allies were three or four 
times the number of the men of Munster, or more.</p>
<p>Now the men of Munster came to the battle weak and in disorder. The noise in 
this battle was grievous, as the learned tell (i.e., the people who were in the 
battle), that is, the noise of the one army being slain, and the noise of the 
other army exulting in that slaughter. Now there were two causes that made the 
men of Munster suffer sudden defeat: first, that C&eacute;lechair, kinsman of 
Cenn G&eacute;c&aacute;in, leaped suddenly onto his horse, and as he leaped onto 
his horse, he said: <q>Nobles of Munster,</q> he said, <q>flee at once from this 
horrible battle, and leave it to the clergy themselves, who have given no other 
counsel but to do battle.</q> And he fled immediately after that, and a great 
troop along with him. And then the other cause of the defeat: Cellach son of 
Cerball, when he saw the troop that included the King of Ireland's noble 
followers slaughtering his own troop, leaped upon his horse, and said to his own 
people, <q>Get up on your horses, and drive away the people who are before 
you!</q> And although he said that, it was not really for fighting that he said 
it, but rather in order to flee. What resulted from those causes, then, was the 
unanimous flight of the Munster battalions.</p>
<p>Alas, grievous and great was the slaughter throughout Mag Ailbe after 
that. Clergy were spared no more than laymen there; they were equally 
killed and beheaded. Whenever laymen or cleric was spared there, it was 
 <pb n="157"/>
 
 
not done from mercy, but rather from desire to get ransom for them, or to 
keep them as servants.</p>
<p>Now Cormac the king escaped in the lead of the first troop. But his horse 
jumped into a ditch, and he fell from the horse; when a group of his people saw 
that as they were fleeing, they came to the king and put him back on his horse. 
Then he saw one of his own fostersons, named &Aacute;ed, of the noblemen of the 
E&oacute;ganachta, learned in wisdom and jurisprudence and historical traditions 
and Latin, and the king said to him <q>Beloved son,</q> said he, <q>do not stay 
with me, but get away as best you can. I have told you already that I would be 
killed in this battle.</q></p>
<p>A few stayed with Cormac, and he proceeded along the way on horseback, and 
there was much blood from men and horses along that road. Then the hind legs of 
his horse slipped on the slick road, in the path of that blood; the horse fell 
backwards, and the king fell backwards, and his back and his neck were broken in 
two, and he said as he was falling, <q><frn lang="la">In manus tuas, Domine, commendo spiritum 
meum</frn>.</q> And his spirit departed, and the accursed impious sons went and 
stabbed spears into his body, and hacked his head from his body.</p>
<p>Although many were the slain on Mag Ailbe east of the Berba, the cruelty of 
the Laigin was not satisfied with that, so they pursued the retreat westward 
across Sl&iacute;ab Mairge, and they killed many noblemen in that pursuit.</p>
<p>At the very beginning of the battle Cellach son of Cerball, king of Osraige, 
and his son had immediately been killed. Both laymen and clergy were killed 
severally from then on: many noble clergy were killed in this battle, and many 
kings and chieftains. Fogartach son of Suibne, the sage in philosophy and 
theology, king of Ciarraige, was slain, and Ailill son of 
E&oacute;gan, the distinguished young scholar and nobleman, and Colm&aacute;n, 
abbot of Cenn &Eacute;itig, distinguished master of jurisprudence in Ireland, 
and many others, whom it would be a long task to write down.</p>
<p>The laymen, moreover, were Cormac, king of the D&eacute;issi; Dubuc&aacute;n, 
king of Fir Maige; Cenn F&aacute;elad, king of U&iacute; Conaill; Connadar and 
Aineslis of the U&iacute; Thairdelbaig; and &Eacute;iden, king of Aidne, who was 
in exile in Munster; M&aacute;el Muad; Matud&aacute;n; Dub d&aacute; Bairenn; 
Congal; Catharnach; Feradach; &Aacute;ed, king of U&iacute; Liathain; and 
Domnall, king of D&uacute;n Cermna.</p>
<p>These are the men who won the battle: Flann son of M&aacute;el Sechlainn, 
King of Ireland; and Cerball son of Muirec&aacute;n, king of Laigin; and Tadc 
son of F&aacute;el&aacute;n, king of U&iacute; Ceinnselaig; Temen&aacute;n, king 
of U&iacute; Dega; Cellach and Lorcc&aacute;n, two kings of Fir Cualann; 
Indeirge son of Dub Gilla, king of U&iacute; Dr&oacute;na; Follaman son of 
Ailill, king of Fotharta Fea; Tuathal son of Augaire, king of U&iacute; 
Muiredaig; Augr&aacute;n son of Cenn&eacute;tig, 
 <pb n="159"/>
 
 
king of Lo&iacute;ches; M&aacute;el Calland son of Fergal, king of the 
Fortuatha; Cl&eacute;irchen, king of U&iacute; Bairrchi.</p>
<p>Flann, King of Ireland, came after that with a large troop of royal 
horsemen, and installed Diarmait son of Cerball in the kingship of Osraige.</p>
<p>Then a group came before Flann, and they had the head of Cormac the king; 
they said to Flann, <q>Life and health, triumphant powerful king: we have the 
head of Cormac for you; and as is the custom with kings, raise your thigh, and 
put this head under it, and crush it with your thigh.</q>
 
<q>That is indeed evil,</q> said Flann to them, and it was not thanks that he 
gave them. <q>It was an evil deed,</q> he said, <q>to cut off the holy bishop's 
head; I shall honour it, and not crush it.</q> Flann took the head in his hands, 
and kissed it, and he carried the consecrated head and the true martyr around 
him three times. After that the head was honourably brought from him to the 
body, in the place where M&oacute;enach son of Siadal, successor of Comgall, 
was, and he took Cormac's body to D&iacute;sert Diarmata, and it was greatly 
honoured there, where it produces omens and miracles.</p>
<p>Why, then, should the heart not be moved and mourn this awful deed, that is, 
the killing and hacking up (with abominable weapons) of the holy person who was 
the most skilled that ever was or will be of the men of Ireland? A scholar in 
Irish and in Latin, the wholly pious and pure chief bishop, miraculous in 
chastity and in prayer, a sage in government, in all wisdom, knowledge and 
science, a sage of poetry and learning, chief of charity and every virtue; a 
wise man in teaching, high king of the two provinces of all Munster in his time. 
...</p>
<p>Flann, the King of Ireland, returned then, after leaving Diarmait in the 
kingship of Osraige and making a peace in partnership between him and his 
kinsmen. The Laigin returned also with triumph and spoils. Cerball son of 
Muirec&aacute;n, king of the Laigin proceeded to Cell Dara with great troops of 
captives, and Flaithbertach son of Inmain&eacute;n among those. The evil things 
that certain scholars of Leinster said about Flaithbertach are shameful to tell, 
and improper to write.</p>
<p>Flaithbertach was brought to Cell Dara then, and the clergy of Leinster 
reproached him severely, for they knew that it had been he alone who had urged 
the hosting and the battle, and that Cormac had come against his will. However, 
after the death of Cerball, king of the Laigin, Flaithbertach was released, 
which was at the end of that year, according to some. Muirenn, successor of 
Brigit, along with a large group of clergy and many relics, escorted him to Mag 
n-Airb, and when he arrived in Munster he made peace there. Afterwards he went to 
his monastery on Inis Cathaig, and he spent a while there piously, until he came 
out again to take the kingship of Cashel, and he was king of Munster for 
thirty-two years.</p>

<p><sup resp="JR">?907</sup> We have related above, that 
is, in the fourth year previously, that the Norwegian armies were driven out of 
Ireland, thanks to the fasting 
 <pb n="169"/>
 
 
and prayers of the holy man, C&eacute;le Dabaill, for 
he was a saintly and pious man, and he had great zeal for the Christians; and 
besides inciting the warriors of Ireland against the pagans, he laboured himself 
through fasting and prayer, and he strove for freedom for the churches of 
Ireland, and he strengthened the men of Ireland by his laborious service to the 
Lord; and he removed the anger of the Lord from them. For it was on account of 
the Lord's anger against them that the foreigners were brought to destroy them 
(i.e., the Norwegians and Danes), to plunder Ireland, both church and tribe.</p>
<p>Now the Norwegians left Ireland, as we said, and their leader was Ingimund, 
and they went then to the island of Britain. The son of Cadell son of Rhodri was 
king of the Britons at that time. The Britons assembled against them, and gave 
them hard and strong battle, and they were driven by force out of British 
territory.</p>
<p>After that Ingimund with his troops came to Aethelflaed, Queen of the Saxons; 
for her husband, Aethelred, was sick at that time. (Let no one reproach me, 
though I have related the death of Aethelred above, because this was prior to 
Aethelred's death and it was of this very sickness that Aethelred died, but I 
did not wish to leave unwritten what the Norwegians did after leaving Ireland.) 
Now Ingimund was asking the Queen for lands in which he would settle, and on 
which he would build barns and dwellings, for he was tired of war at that time. 
Aethelflaed gave him lands near Chester, and he stayed there for a time.</p>
<p>What resulted was that when he saw the wealthy city, and the choice lands 
around it, he yearned to possess them. Ingimund came then to the chieftains of 
the Norwegians and Danes; he was complaining bitterly before them, and said that 
they were not well off unless they had good lands, and that they all ought to go 
and seize Chester and possess it with its wealth and lands. From that there 
resulted many great battles and wars. What he said was, <q>Let us entreat and 
implore them ourselves first, and if we do not get them <sup resp="JR">good lands</sup> willingly 
like that, let us fight for them by force.</q> All the chieftains of the 
Norwegians and Danes consented to that.</p>
<p>Ingimund returned home after that, having arranged for a hosting to follow 
him. Although they held that council secretly, the Queen learned of it. The 
Queen then gathered a large army about her from the adjoining regions, and 
filled the city of Chester with her troops.</p>
<p><sup resp="JR">?918</sup> Almost at the same time the men of Foirtriu and the Norwegians fought a battle. The men of Alba fought this battle steadfastly, moreover, because Colum 
Cille was assisting them, for they had prayed fervently to him, since  
 <pb n="171"/>
 
 
he was their apostle, and it was through him that they received faith. For on 
another occasion, when Imar Conung was a young lad and he came to plunder Alba 
with three large troops, the men of Alba, lay and clergy alike, fasted and 
prayed to God and Colum Cille until morning, and beseeched the Lord, and gave 
profuse alms of food and clothing to the churches and to the poor, and received 
the Body of the Lord from the hands of their priests, and promised to do every 
good thing as their clergy would best urge them, and that their battle-standard 
in the van of every battle would be the Crozier of Colum Cille&mdash;and it is 
on that account that it is called the <term lang="ga" type="halidom">Cathbuaid</term>  <sup resp="JR">'Battle-Triumph'</sup> from then onwards; and the name is fitting, for they have often won victory in battle with it, as they did at that time, relying on Colum Cille. They acted the same way on this occasion. Then this battle was fought hard and fiercely; the men of Alba 
won victory and triumph, and many of the Norwegians were killed after their 
defeat, and their king was killed there, namely Oittir son of Iarngna. For a 
long time after that neither the Danes nor the Norwegians attacked them, and 
they enjoyed peace and tranquillity. But let us turn to the story that we 
began.</p>
<p>The armies of the Danes and the Norwegians mustered to attack Chester, and 
since they did not get their terms accepted through request or entreaty, they 
proclaimed battle on a certain day. They came to attack the city on that day, 
and there was a great army with many freemen in the city to meet them. When the 
troops who were in the city saw, from the city wall, the many hosts of the Danes 
and Norwegians coming to attack them, they sent messengers to the King of the 
Saxons, who was sick and on the verge of death at that time, to ask his advice 
and the advice of the Queen. What he advised was that they do battle outside, 
near the city, with the gate of the city open, and that they choose a troop of 
horsemen to be concealed on the inside; and those of the people of the city who 
would be strongest in battle should flee back into the city as if defeated, and 
when most of the army of the Norwegians had come in through the gate of the 
city, the troop that was in hiding beyond should close the gate after that 
horde, and without pretending any more they should attack the throng that had 
come into the city and kill them all.</p>
<p>Everything was done accordingly, and the Danes and Norwegians were 
frightfully slaughtered in that way. Great as that massacre was, however, the 
Norwegians did not abandon the city, for they were hard and savage; but they all 
said that they would make many hurdles, and place props under them, and that 
they would make a hole in the wall underneath them. This was not delayed; the 
hurdles were made, and the hosts were under them making a hole in the wall, 
because they wanted to take the city, and avenge their people.</p>
<p>It was then that the King (who was on the verge of death) and the Queen 
 <pb n="173"/>
 
 
sent messengers to the Irish who were among the pagans (for the pagans had many 
Irish fosterlings), to say to the Irishmen, <q>Life and health to you from the 
King of the Saxons, who is ill, and from the Queen, who holds all authority over 
the Saxons, and they are certain that you are true and trustworthy friends to 
them. Therefore you should take their side: for they have given no greater honour to any Saxon warrior or cleric than they have given to each warrior or cleric who has come to them from Ireland, for this inimical race of pagans is equally hostile to you also. You must, then, since 
you are faithful friends, help them on this occasion.</q> This was the same as 
saying to them, <q>Since we have come from faithful friends of yours to converse 
with you, you should ask the Danes what gifts in lands and property they would 
give to the people who would betray the city to them. If they will make terms 
for that, bring them to swear an oath in a place where it would be convenient to 
kill them, and when they are taking the oath on their swords and their shields, 
as is their custom, they will put aside all their good shooting weapons.</q></p>
<p>All was done accordingly, and they set aside their arms. And the reason why 
those Irish acted against the Danes was because they were less friends to them 
than the Norwegians. Then many of them were killed in that way, for huge rocks 
and beams were hurled onto their heads. Another great number were killed by 
spears and by arrows, and by every means of killing men.</p>
<p>However, the other army, the Norwegians, was under the hurdles, making a hole 
in the wall. What the Saxons and the Irish who were among them did was to hurl 
down huge boulders, so that they crushed the hurdles on their heads. What they 
did to prevent that was to put great columns under the hurdles. What the Saxons 
did was to put the ale and water they found in the town into the towns 
cauldrons, and to boil it and throw it over the people who were under the 
hurdles, so that their skin peeled off them. The Norwegians response to that was 
to spread hides on top of the hurdles. The Saxons then scattered all the 
beehives there were in the town on top of the besiegers, which prevented them 
from moving their feet and hands because of the number of bees stinging them. 
After that they gave up the city, and left it. Not long afterwards there was 
fighting again ...</p>

<p>A raid on Osraige by Cormac, king

destroyed. The Osraige killed the brother of this Cormac, i.e. Cuilenn&aacute;n.

slaughter between them. Now the son of &Aacute;ed son of Dub Gilla&mdash;the son,

<p>In that year great armies of Dark Foreigners and Fair 
Foreigners <sup resp="JR">Danish and Norwegian Vikings</sup> came again to 
attack the Saxons, after the installation of Sitric grandson of Imar as king. 
They challenged the Saxons to battle, and the Saxons did not delay, but came at 
once to attack the pagans. A hard and ferocious battle was fought between them, 
and there was great energy and heat and contention on both sides. Much noble 
blood was spilled in this battle; nevertheless, it was the Saxons who won 
victory and spoils after massacring the pagans. For the king of the pagans was 
taken ill, and he was carried out of the battle to a forest nearby, and he died 
there.</p>
<p>Now Oittir, the most greatly esteemed earl in this battle, when he saw the 
Saxons slaughtering his people, fled into a dense wood near him, along with 
those of his people who survived. A huge throng of Saxons came after him, and 
they surrounded the wood. The Queen commanded them to hack down all of the 
forest with their swords and battleaxes, and they did so. First they felled the 
trees, and then all the pagans who were in the wood were killed. The pagans were 
slaughtered by the Queen like that, so that her fame spread in all 
directions.</p>
<p>Aethelflaed, through her own cleverness, made peace with the men of Alba and 
with the Britons, so that whenever the same race should come to attack her, they 
would rise to help her. If it were against them that they came, she would take 
arms with them. While this continued, the men of Alba and Britain overcame the 
settlements of the Norwegians and destroyed and sacked them.</p>
<pb n="183"/>
<p>The king of the Norwegians came after that and sacked Srath Cluada, 
and plundered the land. But the enemy was ineffectual against Srath 
Cluada.</p>
