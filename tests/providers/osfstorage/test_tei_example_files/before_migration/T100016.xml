<p>The CS was copied by <name id="DMF">Dubhaltach Mac Firbhisigh</name>. The present translation comprises the Pre-Christian section (in narrative form), and the Prepatrician (353&ndash;431) and Postpatrician sections in annal
from (432 to 549, 550&ndash;722, 804&ndash;1135, and 1141&ndash;1150). 
For years 550&ndash;1150 Gear&oacute;id Mac Niocaill's unpublished edition, donated to CELT in 2001, was used. His dating deviates from Hennessy's edition. From the Incipit to 549 and for most of the poems, the translation has been supplemented from Hennessy. He gives the marginal MS dates, which have been retained for the entries predating 550, though the dates are not historical. 
For the years 550&ndash;1150 Mac Niocaill's dating has been used. There is still some uncertainty around the dates, and it is hoped to integrate Dr Daniel Mac Carthy's findings in a later draft. Missing text supplied by the respective editor is tagged <emph>sup resp=""</emph> with "GMN" or "WMH" indicated in the <emph>resp</emph> attribute.

<head><frn lang="la">INCIPIT CRONICUM SCOTORUM</frn>, i.e. THE CHRONICLE OF THE
SCOTI IS BEGUN HERE.</head>
<opener>Understand, Reader, that for a certain reason, and plainly to avoid
tediousness, what we desire is to make a short Abstract and Compendium of
the History of the Scoti only in this copy, leaving out the lengthened
details of the Books of History; wherefore it is that we entreat of you not
to reproach us therefor, as we know that it is an exceedingly great
deficiency.</opener>
<p>The First Age of the world contains 1656 years according to the Hebrews,
but 2242 according to the Seventy Interpreters; all which perished in the
Deluge, in the same manner that oblivion is wont to swallow up infancy. Ten
generations. Thus do the Gaedhel express the number of this age:&mdash;

<text type="poem">
<body>
<lg n="1" type="quatrain">
<l>Six years, fifty, and six hundred,</l>
<l>as I reckon,</l>
<l>A great thousand I count</l>
<l>from Adam to the Flood.</l>
</lg>
</body>
</text></p>
<p>Kal. v. f. l. 10. Anno Mundi 1599. <add place="margin">A.M. 1599</add> In
this year the daughter of one of the Greeks came to Hibernia, whose name was
hEriu, or Berba, or Cesar, and fifty maidens, and three men, with her.
Ladhra was their conductor, who was the first that was buried in Hibernia.
This the antiquaries of the Scoti do not relate.</p>
<pb n="5"/>
<p>The Second Age of the world begins, which contains 292 years, that is
according to the Hebrews, as the poet says:&mdash;

<text type="poem">
<body>
<lg n="1" type="quatrain">
<l>From the Flood to Abraham,</l>
<l>who was happily born,</l>
<l>Two full, prosperous years,</l>
<l>ninety and two hundred;</l>
</lg>
</body>
</text>
but according to the <sup resp="WMH">lxx.</sup> Interpreters, 940 years.</p>
<p>Kal. Anno Mundi 1859. <add place="margin">A.M.1859</add> Ten years after
that to the demolition of the Tower. Nine years after that to Fenius. In
this year Fenius composed the language of the Gaeidhel from seventy-two
languages, and subsequently committed it to Gaeidhel, son of Agnoman, viz.,
in the tenth year after the destruction of Nimrod's Tower.</p>
<p>The Third Age commences, which contains 942 years, and it begins with the
birth of Abraham, as the poet said:&mdash;

<text type="poem">
<body>
<lg n="1" type="quatrain">
<l>From that birth,without peril,</l>
<l>to David, the faithful prince,</l>
<l>Forty-two years</l>
<l>and nine hundred, certainly.</l>
</lg>
</body>
</text></p>
<p>In the sixtieth year of the age of Abraham, Parrthalon arrived in
Hibernia. This Parrthalon was the first who occupied Erinn after the Flood.
On a Tuesday, the 14th of May, he arrived, his companions being eight in
numher, viz.:&mdash;four men and four women. They multiplied afterwards
until they were in number 4,050 men and 1,000 women.</p>
<p>There were four plains cleared in Erinn by Parrthalon, viz.:&mdash;Magh
Tuiredh, or nEdara, in Connacht; and Magh Sere in Connacht; and Magh Ita in
Laighen; and Magh Latrainn D&aacute;l Araidhe; and Lecmagh in Ui Mac Uais,
between Bir and Camus.</p>
<p>Seven years after the occupation of Erinn by Parrthalon,<pb n="7"/>

the first man of his people died, viz.:&mdash;Fea was his name. In Magh Fea
he was buried; from him, therefore, it has been named.</p>
<p>There were seven lake eruptions through the land in the reign of
Parrthalon, viz.:&mdash;Loch Mesca, and Loch Decet, Loch Laighline, Loch
Rudhraidhe, Loch Echtra, and the sea inundation of Brena, <sup resp="WMH" source="other Irish sources">and Loch Con</sup>.</p>
<p>Three years afterwards occurred the first battle which Parrthalon gained,
in the Slemains of Magh Itha, over the Fomorians, viz.:&mdash;they were
Demons, truly, in the guise of men, i.e. men with one hand and one leg
each.</p>
<p>In the succeeding year died Slangia, the fourth chieftain of Erinn, who
was interred by Parrthalon in Sliahh Slanga; hence from him the mountain has
been named.</p>
<p>The year after Slanga's death occurred the eruption of Loch Laighline,
and his death; <frn lang="la">unde prius nominatur</frn>; (he was the fourth
chieftain of Erinn; in digging his grave the lake burst forth); and the
eruption of Loch Echtra, between Sliabh Modharn and Sliabh Fuaid. Twenty
years afterwards occurred the eruption of Loch Rudraidhe, in Uladh.</p>
<p>In the same year the sea inundation of Brena broke over the land, so that
it is the seventh lake; for Parrthalon found in Erinn before him but three
lakes and ten rivers, viz.:&mdash;Loch Luimnigh, Loch Fordremuin at Sliabh
Mis, in Mumhan, and Finn Loch of Irrus Ui Fiachrach. The ten rivers,
moreover, were, the Buas, between D&aacute;l Araidhe and D&aacute;l Riada,
and the Ruirtech or River Liffe; and the Berbha of Laighen; and the Laoi in
Mumhan; and the Samaoir, between Ui Fiachrach and<pb n="9"/>

Cinel Conaill; the Modharn, between Cinel Conaill and Cinel Eoghain; and the
Finn and Banna in Uladh; the Muaidh and Sligech in Connacht.</p>
<p>Four years after the eruption of Brena, the death of Parrthalon took
place. In Sen Magh Ealta he was buried. The reason, moreover, why that is
called Sen Magh is because no tree ever grew there. Five hundred and two, or
402 years, as Eochaidh sang, Parrthalon's people were in Erinn. The first
plague that happened in Erinn after the Flood was the pestilence of
Parrthalon's people. It commenced on Monday, the 1st of May, and prevailed
until the succeeding Sunday. From that plague of Parrthalon's people the
Tamhleachda of the men of Erinn are called.</p>
<p>Erinn was waste for thirty years after the death of Parrthalon, until
Nimhedh, son of Adhnoman  <uncl>.uu.</uncl><note n="1" type="auth">Meaning
not clear unless .uu. represents 'da coig' for 'da coid' 'who went'.</note>
came to Inbher Sgene. He occupied Erinn afterwards, as it is related in the
Invasions of Erinn.</p>
<p>Kal. Anno Mundi 2355. <add place="margin">A.M.2355</add> At this time the
Fir Bolg occupied Erinn. But this has not been proved.</p>
<p>Kal. Anno Mundi 2390. <add place="margin">A.M.2390</add> In this time the
Tuatha De Danann, viz., Dealbaeth, and Bress, the Daghda, Nuadha, and Ogmha,
and the rest, overcame the Fir Bolg.</p>
<p>Kal. Anno Mundi 2544. <add place="margin">A.M.2544</add> Nel, son of
Fenius, learned in many languages, went to Egypt.</p>
<p><note type="comment" resp="DMF">You have heard from me, O Readers, that I
like not to have the labour of writing this section imposed on me, wherefore
it is that I beseech of you, for the sake of true<pb n="11"/>

friendship, not to reproach me for it (if the reason thereof is understood
by you), for it is certain that it is not the Clann Firbisigh who are in
fault.</note></p>
<p>Kal. Milidh, son of Bile, proceeded then from Spain to Scythia, and from
Scythia to Egypt, after the slaying of Reflor, son of Neman (as it is found
in the Invasions of Erinn); and understand not that it was soon after the
death of Nel in Egypt, but many years, indeed, after it, that Milidh
departed from Scythia, after the slaying of Reflor, contending for the
sovereignty of Scythia. His great fleet consisted of 100 ships, as the
vellum relates from which this copy has been drawn; fifteen families in each
ship, and soldiers without wives in it besides. They remained three months
in the island of Taprobane. Three months more, also, they were on the Red
Sea, until they came to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. They learned the arts of
that country. They remained eight years with Pharaoh in Egypt, where they
propagated their various arts and their various actions. Scota, Pharaoh's
daughter, married Milidh, son of Bile. After that, Milidh went with his host
on the great sea, (and Scota, Pharaoh's daughter, along with him), past the
island of Taprobane, in which they stayed a month. They rowed afterwards
round Scythia to the "Inbher" of the Caspian Sea. They remained three <frn lang="ga">nomada</frn> motionless on the Caspian Sea, through the chaunting
of mermaids, until Caicher, the druid, rescued them. They voyaged afterwards
past the point of Sliabh Rife until they landed in Dacia. They stayed a
month there.<pb n="13"/>

Caicher, the druid, said to them, <q>we shall not stay until we reach
Erinn.</q></p>
<p>They subsequently passed by Gothia, by Germany, to Bregann, until they
occupied Spain. It was uninhabited on their arrival. They remained there
thirty years, and fought fifty-four battles against Frisians, and
Longobards, and Bachru; and they were all gained by Milidh, son of Bile. For
the right of Spain these battles were fought; and hence he was called
"Milidh of Spain". And it was in it Milidh's two sons, Eremon and hErennan,
were born. These were the two youngest. The two oldest were Donn and Ebhir;
for in the east, in Scythia, Donn was born, and Ebhir in Egypt.</p>
<p>Twelve families died of a plague in one day in Spain, together with their
three kings, viz.:&mdash;Milidh, son of Bile, Uige, and Oige. Forty-seven
families and four soldiers went with the sons of Milidh, and with Scota,
Pharaoh's daughter, on the sea to Erinn. They subsequently proceeded to land
in Erinn at Inbher Slaini. They sailed round Erinn thrice, until finally
they came to Inbher Sgene. Erenan, the youngest of Milidh's sons, went up
into the mast to see how far they were from the land. He was drowned there,
so that his limbs were severed by rocks, and, in dying, his head was placed
on his mothers breast and gave forth a sigh. <q>No wonder</q>, said his
mother, <q>Erenan's going between two Inbhers, but he reached not the Inbher
to which he came; he separated from the Inbher from which he came</q>. In
that day there came a terrible storm, and the ship in which was Donn, son of
Milidh, with fifty men, twelve women, and four soldiers, was cast away, so
that they were drowned at the Dumacha in the western sea, called Tech
nDuinn.</p>
<pb n="15"/>
<p>On Thursday, the Kalends of May, on the l7th of the Moon, the fleet of
the sons of Milidh occupied Erinn at Inbher Sgene, and the wife of Aimergin
Gluingil, i.e. Sgene Davilsir, died there, and her grave was made there;
hence it was called Inbher Sgene. Erennan's grave was placed on the other
side.</p>
<p>The third day after the occupation of Erinn by the sons of Miledh, they
fought the battle of Sliabh Mis against demons and Fomorians, and the sons
of Milidh gained it, and they assumed the sovereignty of Erinn very soon
afterwards; and so forth.</p>
