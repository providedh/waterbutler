<p> A contention was begun by Sliocht Eóghain

Ciarraighe, and Toirdhealbhach son of Ruaidhrí [Ó

Luachra they spent a night there burning and plundering. On the
following day they were routed by the Ciarraighe at the head of
Sliabh Mis and they suffered slaughter. Toirdhealbhach Ó

large force together with their trains across the Shannon and into
Ciarraighe to meet each other in Uí Chonaill. They banished
Diarmaid son of Cormac Muighe Thamhnach southwards across Móin

Féardhruim in Uí Eachach. It was at this time that
Diarmaid Súgach Ó Conchobhair took seven ships on
wheels from Eas Duibhe to Loch Léin. From Limerick to Cork,
and from Waterford to Cnoc Bréanainn was laid waste in this
war. Síol Briain pursued Diarmaid Mac Carthaigh through
Múiscraighe southwards to Ceann Eich to plunder it. Diarmaid
son of Cormac and the nobles of the Eóghanachta sent messengers to
ask [the support of] Toirdhealbhach son of Ruaidhrí, king of
Connacht, and Diarmaid Mac Murchadha, king of Leinster, against
Síol Briain. It was the night the Connachtmen and the
Leinstermen came to Abha Mhór that Síol Briain came to
Cork. They set out on the following day through Móin
Mhór northwards, having committed many outrages on the
community of Barra; and Cormac's son, the Uí Mhathghamhna, the
Uí Dhonnchadha, the Uí Chaoimh, and the Uí
Mhuircheartaigh, as well as the nobles of the Eóghanacht, were
at their rear in pursuit of them. The day being misty, Síol
Briain did not perceive the Connachtmen and the Leinstermen until
they found themselves in their midst. Síol Briain were defeated
by these three hostings, and Conchobhar Ó Briain,
Flaithbheartach Ó Deadhaidh, Aineislis Ó Gráda,
and three thousand others of the host were slain. Toirdhealbhach
Ó Briain and Diarmaid Súdgach Ó Conchobhair,

through the mist past Abha Mhór northwards. Ó
Conchobhair sent word to Inis Faithlinn informing the people there of
the defeat. When word reached them, they sprang to their ships, and
leaving them at the north side of Loch Léin they went
themselves to Ciarraighe without being noticed. Diarmaid son of
Cormac Muighe Thamhnach went with the nobles of Sliocht
Eóghain to Ciarraighe, and they plundered and levelled their

<p>A.D. 1167. Mac Murchadha came to an agreement with the king of Wales concerning the help he had promised to send with him to Ireland. The king aided him by giving him Robert FitzStephen, whom he had in prison for three years, and by affirming to Mac Murchadha that he would come to Ireland with him in consideration of his release, together with as much of a following as he could get. Mac Murchadha crossed the sea from there to Fearna, and was in hiding there throughout the Spring.</p>

<p>Robert FitzStephen came to Ireland, as he
had promised Mac Murchadha, with thirty knights, three score esquires, and
three hundred archers. They made port at Banabh, and leaving their ships,
encamped at the harbour until Mac Murchadha arrived with five hundred
supporters. The principal knights who came there with Robert FitzStephen were,
Maurice FitzGerald, Robert de Barry, Meiler FitzHenry, and Hervey de
Montmorency: it was this Hervey who endowed the monastery of Dúin
Bróith. They confirmed their agreement, and unfurling their banners they
proceeded with one accord to attack Wexford, and captured it. After its
capture, Mac Murchadha, as he had promised, handed it over to Robert
FitzStephen and Maurice FitzGerald, together with the county to the east and
the west of it. He went from thence to Osraighe, where he inflicted slaughter
and took hostages from Mac Giolla Phádraig as an earnest of submission
to him.</p>

<p>An account of these
events reached Ruaidhrí Ó Conchobhair, who was titled King of
Ireland at that time. He assembled those of the forces of Ireland who were his
lieges, and went to Fearna. Mac Murchadha was in the fastnesses of a wood near
Fearna, and they made peace: Diarmaid Mac Murchadha was to receive Ó
Conchobhair's daughter as wife, and Mac Murchadha was to send back the knights,
and not to bring any more foreigners to Ireland, nor to support them there. He
gave up his own halidoms and his son to Ó Conchobhair in token of his
fulfilment of that agreement.</p>

<p>A short time after this, Mac Murchadha sent letters to England for Richard,
Earl of Striguil. The Earl sent Raymond le Gros FitzGerald with ten knights

of the paternal uncle of Robert FitzStephen and Maurice FitzGerald, according
to the books of the Galls.</p>

<p>Raymond landed, four miles east of
Waterford, and when Maol Seachlainn Ó Faoláin and the people of
Waterford learned of his arrival, they set out, three thousand strong, to
attack Raymond in the fortress in which he was. Raymond struck the first man of
them who crossed the moat on the head with his sword, and split his head in
two. When the crowd nearest saw this, they at once fled, towards their people,
and when the rearguard saw the van fleeing towards them, they too fled, and the
English pursued them and inflicted slaughter on them by drowning and by
killing.</p>
